# Practice Test 4

## 질문 1

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. The latest evaluation run reports 97.4% overall extraction accuracy across the validation set, and stakeholders want to reduce human review based on that result. What should this team do before changing the review policy?

**A** . Rerun the prompt comparison in the Console and deploy the higher average score.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because side-by-side prompt comparison and average quality scores help compare prompt versions, but they do not automatically establish per-segment reliability. The team still needs task-specific evaluation slices before changing review coverage.

**B(정답)** . Segment the evaluation by document type and extracted field before changing review thresholds.

**설명** :
This is correct because a high aggregate score can hide concentrated failures in rarer document categories or specific fields. Segmenting the evaluation makes the success criteria more specific and measurable before reducing human review.

**C** . Expand the validation set and keep the same single overall accuracy threshold for release.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because a larger test set can still obscure poor subgroup performance if results are only aggregated. The issue is not just sample size, it is whether the evaluation measures the dimensions that matter in production.

**D** . Switch every extraction check to exact-match grading and approve the aggregate result.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because exact match can be useful for objective fields, but it does not solve hidden performance variation across document types or fields. A single aggregate exact-match score can still mask systematic failures in a smaller segment.

### 전반적인 설명

A strong overall accuracy number is useful, but it is not enough for production decisions when failures have uneven impact. Anthropic’s evaluation guidance emphasizes specific and measurable success criteria, and notes that many use cases require multidimensional evaluation rather than a single aggregate score, see Define success criteria.

For structured extraction, the practical risk is that common, easy documents dominate the average while rarer formats or high-value fields fail more often. The right mental model is to evaluate the task distribution the system will actually see, including edge cases, then report accuracy by meaningful slices such as document type and extracted field.

Exact-match grading, larger datasets, and prompt comparison tools can all be useful parts of an evaluation workflow, but none replaces segmented analysis. Anthropic’s classification guidance defines accuracy as correct predictions over total predictions, which explains why a single aggregate can hide where the incorrect predictions are concentrated, see Classification. The Console evaluation tool can support comparing prompts and grading outputs, but the team must design the test set and analysis to reveal subgroup performance, see Claude Console Evaluation Tool.

## 질문 2

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Claude responds with stop_reason: "tool_use" and includes two client validate_extraction tool_use blocks in the same assistant turn. Your wrapper runs both validators, then starts a fresh request with only a plain text user message summarizing the results. What should the wrapper do instead so Claude can reason about the next extraction action?

**A** . Append two following user messages, one per validator result, each containing a matching tool_result block.

**설명** :
Parallel tool calls from one assistant turn should be answered together in a single following user message. Splitting the results across separate user messages is the wrong format and can reduce future parallel tool use.

**B** . Append a new user text message summarizing the validator outputs before sending any tool_result blocks.

**설명** :
A plain text summary does not satisfy the client tool protocol. Tool results must immediately follow the assistant tool_use message, and any text in that user message must come after the tool_result blocks.

**C** . Append one assistant message containing both validator outputs as tool_result blocks matched by tool_use_id.

**설명** :
Tool_result blocks are not assistant-authored content in Claude's tool-use format. Placing them in an assistant message misrepresents the exchange and prevents the client tool output from being returned in the documented message structure.

**D(정답)** . Append the assistant tool_use response, then send one following user message containing both tool_result blocks matched by tool_use_id.

**설명** :
For client-executed tools, the application must preserve the assistant turn that requested the tools and then return tool outputs in a user message. Matching each result to the original tool_use id lets Claude connect each validator output to the correct requested validation and continue the loop.

### 전반적인 설명

In Claude's client tool-use loop, Claude does not execute the tool itself. It returns structured tool_use blocks in an assistant message, your application runs the requested operation, then the next request includes a user message with matching tool_result blocks. This message history is what lets Claude use the validator outputs to decide whether to repair the extraction, call another tool, or produce a final answer.

The important mental model is that tool use is part of the normal assistant and user message structure, not a separate tool or function role. The documented loop requires appending the original messages, the assistant response containing tool_use, and the immediately following user message containing tool_result; see How tool use works and Handle tool calls. When multiple client tool calls appear in one assistant turn, return all corresponding results together in one user message, as described in Parallel tool use.

## 질문 3

You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses the built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. A developer productivity team uses the Claude Messages API during codebase exploration to produce a dependency map consumed by an internal dashboard. The current prompt says, "Return only JSON matching this schema," but logs show occasional trailing commentary, missing fields, or string values where arrays are expected, causing parser failures. The dashboard integration is designed to consume a tool call rather than free-form assistant text. What change would most reliably enforce schema-compliant output?

**A** . Create a custom MCP server that validates the parsed JSON after the response and rejects invalid dashboard payloads.

**설명** :
Validation after parsing can catch bad outputs, but it does not prevent JSON syntax errors or guarantee a conforming tool input on the first response. MCP can expose useful tools, but simply adding a server-side validator does not replace strict schema-constrained generation.

**B** . Keep the JSON schema in the prompt, add stronger wording that only valid JSON is acceptable, and retry failed parses.

**설명** :
Prompt wording and retries can improve consistency, but they do not provide the documented schema guarantee. Without structured outputs, Claude can still produce malformed JSON, missing fields, inconsistent types, or schema violations.

**C** . Prefill the assistant response with an opening brace, add a stop sequence, and parse the returned text as JSON.

**설명** :
Prefill and stop sequences can steer formatting, but they still rely on generated text being syntactically and semantically aligned with the schema. This approach is less reliable than constrained structured output mechanisms when downstream parsing must not fail.

**D(정답)** . Define a client tool in the tools array with input_schema, set strict: true, and force that tool with tool_choice.

**설명** :
This uses Anthropic's strict tool use mechanism, which constrains the tool name and tool input to the provided schema. Forcing the tool call also prevents Claude from choosing to answer in normal text instead of emitting the required tool_use block.

### 전반적인 설명

For a workflow that must consume a tool_use block through the Messages API, the strongest pattern is to define a client tool in the top-level tools array with a JSON Schema input_schema, add strict: true, and use tool_choice to require the desired tool call. Strict tool use applies grammar-constrained sampling so the tool name is valid and the tool input follows the schema, while tool_choice addresses the separate question of whether Claude must call a tool at all.

The common anti-pattern is treating "return only JSON" as a guarantee. Prompt-only JSON, prefilling, and stop sequences can reduce failures, but Anthropic documents that without structured outputs Claude can still produce malformed JSON, missing fields, inconsistent types, or other schema violations. Post-generation validation remains useful for business-rule checks and retry loops, but it is not the mechanism that prevents malformed free-form JSON from reaching the parser.

See Anthropic's documentation on Structured outputs, Strict tool use, and Implement tool use.

Domain 4: Prompt Engineering & Structured Output

## 질문 4

You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses the built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Evaluations show two recurring issues: report generation stalls on minor evidence questions, while prior attempts to broaden the synthesis role caused it to duplicate exploration work. What change best improves this design?


**A(정답)** . Give the synthesis subagent a narrow verify_fact tool and route broader investigation requests through the coordinator.

**설명** :
This balances efficiency with role boundaries by allowing the synthesis subagent to handle frequent, low-risk checks without taking on open-ended exploration. It preserves specialization while avoiding unnecessary coordinator round trips for routine verification.

**B** . Merge synthesis and exploration into one subagent with a single prompt and shared tool permissions.

**설명** :
This reduces handoffs, but it gives up the benefits of specialized subagents with scoped permissions and independent context. A single broad role is more likely to mix exploration, verification, and reporting concerns in ways that make behavior harder to constrain.

**C** . Remove all tool access from the synthesis subagent and require coordinator approval for every evidence check.

**설명** :
This preserves a strict separation of responsibilities, but it keeps the observed bottleneck in place. The coordinator would remain responsible for even routine checks, increasing latency and coordination overhead.

**D** . Give the synthesis subagent the same Read, Grep, Glob, and Bash access used by the exploration subagent.

**설명** :
This would make the synthesis role more capable, but it also expands its action space enough to recreate the duplication already observed. Broad tool access weakens specialization and can reduce reliability when a subagent should focus on reporting rather than investigation.

### 전반적인 설명

For subagent-based systems, the goal is not to give every role every tool it might conceivably need. A better pattern is scoped cross-role capability: provide a constrained tool for high-frequency, low-risk needs, while preserving the coordinator as the path for complex or open-ended work.

In this case, a narrow verify_fact tool lets the synthesis subagent confirm small evidence questions without turning into a second exploration agent. That matches the subagent design model in which each subagent has its own context window, system prompt, tool access, and permissions, as described in Claude Code subagents. The tradeoff is deliberate: a little carefully scoped autonomy reduces coordination overhead, while broad tools such as shell access or unrestricted codebase search would blur role boundaries and repeat the original failure mode.

Domain 2: Tool Design & MCP Integration

## 질문 5

You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. The search and document-analysis subagents are being connected to separate MCP servers for scholarly search, internal document access, and citation export. A design proposal says the runtime should pick one server as active for a subagent, then reconnect when the subagent needs a tool from another server. What should you recommend instead?


**A(정답)** . Connect each required MCP server for the subagent, list tools after each connection, and expose a unified registry while routing calls to the owning server.

**설명** :
MCP supports a host connecting to one or more MCP servers by maintaining a separate client connection for each server. After connection, each server's tools can be discovered and combined into a unified tool registry for the model, while execution is routed back to the server that owns the selected tool.

**B** . Connect only the MCP server needed for the next research phase, reconnect between phases, and rebuild the subagent's tools before each step.

**설명** :
This treats MCP as if only one server can be active at a time, which is not the documented architecture. Reconnecting between phases adds unnecessary orchestration complexity and prevents the model from selecting across all relevant tools in one agent run.

**C** . Wrap the external services behind one custom MCP server, remove the separate servers, and expose one aggregated research tool to the subagent.

**설명** :
A custom aggregator can be built, but it is not required to let the model use tools from multiple MCP servers. This also collapses distinct tool descriptions and boundaries into a single tool, which can reduce tool selection clarity for specialized research tasks.

**D** . Assign one MCP server to each subagent run, keep other servers unavailable, and spawn a new subagent whenever another server is needed.

**설명** :
This over-partitions the workflow and assumes server access must be isolated by subagent run. MCP allows tools from multiple connected servers to be available to the model together, so new subagents are not needed solely to switch MCP servers.

### 전반적인 설명

MCP is designed around a host, client, server architecture where an application can maintain connections to multiple MCP servers at the same time. The host creates a separate MCP client connection for each server, then discovers capabilities and tools for those servers during connection setup and tool listing.

For tools specifically, the client uses tools/list to obtain each server's available tool metadata, including names, descriptions, and input schemas. The application can then combine tools from all connected MCP servers into a unified tool registry for the language model, while still routing a later tools/call to the MCP session that owns the selected tool.

This design preserves modularity: scholarly search, internal documents, and citation export can remain separate MCP servers while the subagent sees the relevant tools together. Reconnecting between servers, forcing one server per subagent, or hiding everything behind one broad aggregator adds complexity and can weaken tool selection boundaries. See the MCP architecture documentation and the tools specification for the underlying discovery and call model.

## 질문 6

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. During evaluation, invoices with conflicting stated totals and line-item sums often pass the review stage. The current flow asks Claude to extract the JSON, then sends a follow-up prompt asking it to check the prior extraction before the application runs schema validation. Which change best addresses this review blind spot while preserving the validation step?

**A** . Add a follow-up prompt that asks Claude to be skeptical of its previous extraction before validation.

**설명** :
This still relies on a same-conversation review pass where the previous assistant output is part of the context. It may improve phrasing or diligence, but it does not provide the independence needed to catch errors the generator already normalized.

**B** . Insert the extraction as a synthetic assistant message, then ask Claude to audit it against the schema.

**설명** :
Synthetic assistant messages are valid prior turns, but they still become part of the model context for the next response. This can structure the prompt, but it does not make the review independent from the provided assistant answer.

**C** . Require each extracted field to include a confidence value before running the schema validator.

**설명** :
Field confidence can help route uncertain cases, but it does not reliably expose errors the model is already inclined to accept. The issue is the review architecture, not the absence of an additional field in the JSON output.

**D(정답)** . Run a separate review request that receives the source document, extracted JSON, and explicit discrepancy criteria.

**설명** :
This creates a review pass that is not continuing from the same conversational context as the generation pass. Providing the source, extracted output, and objective criteria lets the reviewer compare evidence against the extraction without inheriting the generator's prior conversational trajectory.

### 전반적인 설명

For high-accuracy extraction systems, a review pass should not simply ask the same conversational thread to reconsider its own output. In the Messages API, prior turns included in messages become the model's working context for generating the next response, so the prior extraction can anchor the review instead of being treated as an object to challenge.

The stronger pattern is an independent review instance: make a separate request with the original document, the extracted JSON, and explicit criteria such as comparing stated_total and calculated_total. This preserves the existing schema validation loop while adding a semantic review step that is better positioned to find discrepancies the generator missed.

Anthropic documents that API conversations are stateless unless the developer sends prior turns, and that the context window is the text the model can reference during generation. See Working with messages, Create a Message, and Context windows.

You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses the built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This team is adding a pull request review job with Claude Code GitHub Actions. Early reviews ignore the repository's testing standards, fixture naming conventions, and criteria for when style comments are worth reporting. The guidance must be shared with developers and available to Claude Code during CI runs. What should the team do?

**A** . Put the same guidance in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md on each CI runner image.

**설명** :
The user-level CLAUDE.md location is for personal preferences across projects, not shared team instructions. It would not be the right source of truth for repository-specific review criteria that should travel with the codebase.

**B** . Pass the guidance through claude_args as an appended system prompt.

**설명** :
The claude_args field is for CLI options such as model settings, max turns, and system-prompt appends. Using it as the primary home for repository standards makes the guidance CI-specific rather than shared project context.

**C** . Encode the guidance in the GitHub Actions prompt input for the review workflow only.

**설명** :
The prompt input is appropriate for workflow-specific instructions in a particular GitHub Actions run. It does not provide the project-wide persistent context that developers also receive when using Claude Code locally.

**D(정답)** . Commit a repository-root CLAUDE.md containing the testing standards, fixture conventions, and review criteria.

**설명** :
A repository-root CLAUDE.md is the documented mechanism for persistent, human-written project instructions that Claude Code reads as context. Because it is checked into version control, the same project guidance is available to developers and to CI-invoked Claude Code runs.

### 전반적인 설명

CLAUDE.md is the primary Claude Code mechanism for persistent project context. It is plain Markdown that Claude reads at the start of sessions, and typical contents include coding standards, workflows, build and test commands, naming conventions, and review criteria.

For shared team guidance, the documented project locations include ./CLAUDE.md and ./.claude/CLAUDE.md, which are intended to be checked into version control. The Claude Code GitHub Actions documentation specifically recommends a repository-root CLAUDE.md so CI runs have access to code style guidelines, project-specific rules, preferred patterns, and review criteria.

Workflow inputs still have a role, but they solve a different problem. A GitHub Actions prompt input is useful for instructions unique to that workflow invocation, while CLAUDE.md is the durable project memory shared by local and CI usage. See Claude Code memory and Claude Code GitHub Actions.

Domain 3: Claude Code Configuration & Workflows

## 질문 8

You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. After adding two MCP servers, Claude Code often calls a documentation search tool when developers ask about symbols in the repository, and calls a repository search tool when developers ask about framework policy pages. The tool names are distinct, and both tools support search-like queries. What should the team change first to improve tool selection reliability?

**A** . Add a CLAUDE.md instruction that tells Claude Code to avoid documentation tools unless repository search fails first.

**설명** :
A broad instruction can bias behavior, but it creates a brittle ordering rule that may be wrong for documentation-focused requests. The better fix is to make each tool's description precise so Claude can choose based on the actual user intent.

**B(정답)** . Rewrite each tool description to define use cases, non-use cases, input formats, example queries, returned data, and edge cases.

**설명** :
Tool descriptions are the highest-leverage signal Claude uses when deciding which tool to call. Clear boundaries, expected input formats, examples, outputs, and edge cases help Claude distinguish tools with overlapping capabilities.

**C** . Rename each tool with longer names that encode the target data source, while leaving the existing descriptions unchanged.

**설명** :
Better names can help humans read tool lists, but Claude relies heavily on the description to understand when and how to use a tool. If the descriptions remain ambiguous, misrouting can continue even with more descriptive names.

**D** . Add a project slash command that asks developers to choose the correct search tool before Claude Code begins each task.

**설명** :
A slash command can standardize a workflow, but it shifts tool selection burden to developers and does not improve Claude's own tool selection. This is unnecessarily manual when the underlying issue is ambiguous tool metadata.

### 전반적인 설명

When multiple tools have overlapping names or capabilities, the most reliable first improvement is to make their tool descriptions explicit. Claude uses tool metadata to decide not only what a tool does, but also when it is appropriate, what arguments it expects, and what result it will receive.

A strong description should include the tool's purpose, its boundaries, valid input formats, example queries, expected outputs, and edge cases. For example, a repository search tool might say it searches source files for symbols, imports, error strings, and call sites, while a documentation search tool might say it searches framework guides, policies, and internal docs, and should not be used for locating code references.

Renaming tools, adding broad project instructions, or forcing developers through slash commands can be useful in other situations, but they do not directly repair the model's decision boundary between similar tools. In Claude Code and MCP integrations, well-scoped tools with high-quality descriptions reduce misselection without adding unnecessary workflow friction.

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. A validation rollout starts failing because downstream code still expects the old extraction field name `insured_party`. You do not know which files reference that field, and the file names do not include it. What is the most appropriate first Claude Code tool action?


**A(정답)** . Use Grep to search repository file contents for the exact `insured_party` reference.

**설명** :
This is correct because the task is to find where a string appears inside files. Grep is the appropriate built-in tool for content search when the relevant files are unknown.

**B** . Use Read to load the project root and inspect the directory listing for candidates.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because Read is for loading file contents, not reading directories. It also would not efficiently locate references spread across unknown files.

**C** . Use Bash to run a shell search before trying the dedicated Claude Code tools.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because a dedicated content-search tool already fits the task. Bash can execute shell commands, but using it first adds unnecessary permission and safety surface when Grep is available.

**D** . Use Glob to match repository paths whose filenames include the `insured_party` reference.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because the question states that file names do not include the field name. Glob is useful for matching file paths by pattern, not for finding text inside files.

### 전반적인 설명

The key decision is whether you are searching inside files or searching for file paths. A field name that may appear anywhere in source code, schemas, validators, or tests calls for Grep, because the information you need is in file contents rather than filenames.

Glob is the better fit when the path pattern is the target, such as finding all **/*.schema.json files. Read becomes useful after you have identified candidate files and need full contents with line numbers, while Write and Edit are modification tools rather than discovery tools.

Using Bash for a repository search may work in some environments, but it is a weaker first choice when Claude Code has a purpose-built tool for the same need. The documented tool names and permission behavior are covered in the official Claude Code tools reference, and the general principle is to prefer the narrowest built-in tool that matches the operation.

## 질문 10

You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses the built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. During a month-long exploration of a legacy billing module, the agent’s running summaries start changing exact requirements such as “refund retry limit is 3,” “SLA is 99.95%,” “migration cutoff is 2026-06-30,” and “support promised no customer-visible schema changes” into phrases like “limited retries,” “high availability,” “upcoming cutoff,” and “avoid disruptive changes.” What change should this team make to reduce the risk of incorrect follow-up edits?


**A(정답)** . Maintain a structured scratchpad of exact facts that is updated separately from compacted conversation history.

**설명** :
This preserves precise numerical values, dates, percentages, and stated expectations outside the lossy summary path. It gives the agent a stable source of exact state to reload or include when later edits depend on those details.

**B** . Enable prompt caching for the long system prompt and continue summarizing older turns into concise prose.

**설명** :
Prompt caching can reduce cost and latency for repeated prefixes, but it does not make cached tokens stop counting toward the context window. It also does not prevent summaries from losing exact values when older turns are compressed into vague prose.

**C** . Increase the amount of raw tool output kept in context and summarize only after the window is nearly full.

**설명** :
Keeping more raw output can delay summarization, but more context is not automatically better as recall can degrade as token count grows. Waiting until the context is crowded also increases the chance that important details receive less reliable attention.

**D** . Rewrite summaries to favor broad intent over exact constants so the agent has fewer details to track.

**설명** :
This is the anti-pattern causing the observed failures. Replacing exact constants and commitments with broad intent removes the information needed for reliable code edits and downstream validation.

### 전반적인 설명

Long-running codebase exploration creates a tension between context size and state fidelity. Claude’s context window is working memory, and Anthropic documents that as token count grows, accuracy and recall can degrade, so simply retaining more text is not a complete reliability strategy. The practical pattern is to preserve exact state, such as constants, dates, percentages, and commitments, in a structured scratchpad or facts block that is updated intentionally rather than repeatedly compressed into prose.

Compaction and summarization are useful for managing long conversations, but they are inherently lossy unless the summary preserves the details the task will later need. Anthropic specifically cautions that compaction is less ideal for tasks requiring precise recall of early conversation details or exact state across many variables. That caution applies directly when an agent must later edit code based on exact retry counts, SLA percentages, migration dates, or customer-facing promises.

Prompt caching is a cost and latency optimization, not a memory-preservation mechanism. Anthropic’s context window documentation notes that cached input tokens still count toward the window, so caching does not solve loss of precision from progressive summaries. Learn more in Context windows, Compaction, and Context editing.

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Your extraction validator and downstream submission tools currently return tool_result blocks with is_error set to true, but the content is always "Operation failed" for schema validation failures, malformed source values, service timeouts, and permission denials. Logs show Claude retries some non-retryable failures and escalates some retryable failures inconsistently. What change best improves recovery behavior?

**A** . Expand the tool description to explain that generic failures can have many possible causes.

**설명** :
Tool descriptions help Claude decide when to call a tool, but they do not reveal what happened during a specific failed execution. The recovery decision depends on the actual tool_result returned after the tool call.

**B** . Retry every failed extraction tool call with backoff before returning the same generic message.

**설명** :
Retries help only for failures that are actually transient. Applying retries uniformly wastes time on validation, business, or permission failures and still leaves Claude without recovery context.

**C(정답)** . Return structured tool_result errors with failure category, retryability, message, and corrective guidance.

**설명** :
This gives Claude actionable information about whether to retry, fix inputs, explain a business issue, or escalate. Because the application executes client tools, Claude can only reason from the tool_result content it receives.

**D** . Convert failed extraction tool calls into empty JSON objects that satisfy the downstream schema.

**설명** :
Hiding failures as successful empty outputs prevents Claude and downstream systems from distinguishing absence of data from execution failure. This can silently corrupt extraction quality and make recovery decisions less reliable.

### 전반적인 설명

For client tools, Claude does not execute the operation itself. Claude emits a structured tool_use request, your application runs the tool, and your application sends back a tool_result tied to the original tool_use_id. That means Claude's recovery behavior is limited by the information your application includes in the result.

A uniform message like Operation failed collapses several different situations into one signal. A malformed date, a schema validation issue, a timeout, and a permission denial require different next actions. Structured error metadata lets the agent decide whether to correct an input and retry, retry later, explain a non-retryable business issue, or escalate to a human.

Retries, empty placeholder JSON, and broader tool descriptions each address a different part of the system. Retries only fit transient failures, empty JSON hides failure state, and descriptions guide tool selection rather than communicating execution outcomes. The robust pattern is to return an error-bearing tool_result whose content is specific enough for the next reasoning step.

See Anthropic's documentation on Tool use overview and handling tool calls for the client-tool flow and how tool results are paired with tool use requests.

You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. During testing, the document-analysis subagent repeatedly fails validation because several extracted records lack a methodology summary. Logs show the subagent received only abstract pages for those papers, while the methodology sections are in separate files that were never provided to the subagent. What should the team change first?

**A** . Enable strict tool use on the extraction tool so the missing methodology content is recovered during tool calls.

**설명** :
Strict tool use validates that tool-call parameters match the tool's JSON Schema. It does not give the subagent access to source documents that were not included or retrieved, so it cannot recover absent methodology content.

**B** . Retry the same extraction with validation feedback until every methodology summary field is populated.

**설명** :
Validation feedback is useful when Claude produced malformed JSON, omitted a field that it had enough context to fill, or used the wrong data type. In this case, the missing methodology sections were not supplied, so repeated retries pressure the model to guess rather than correct a recoverable formatting error.

**C(정답)** . Provide the missing methodology sources, and allow an unavailable value when no cited source is in context.

**설명** :
This addresses the actual failure mode: the required information was not present in the subagent's context. Retries can help with format or structural mistakes, but they cannot reliably recover facts from documents the subagent was never given.

**D** . Add few-shot examples of methodology summaries so the subagent infers the missing section consistently.

**설명** :
Few-shot examples can teach format, tone, and decision boundaries for ambiguous extraction cases. They should not be used to infer document-specific facts when the relevant source text is unavailable, because that increases the risk of unsupported claims.

### 전반적인 설명

A reliable extraction pipeline must distinguish recoverable structure errors from missing evidence. If Claude has the relevant source text but returns malformed JSON, the wrong type, or a missing required field, JSON Schema based structured output or validation feedback can address the issue. If the source text itself is absent, the correct engineering response is to supply the missing document, retrieve it with an appropriate subagent or tool, or represent the field as unavailable with a clear coverage gap.

Anthropic's structured output features are designed to reduce or remove retries for schema compliance problems, not to manufacture unavailable facts. JSON outputs constrain Claude's final structured response, while strict: true constrains tool-call inputs to match a JSON Schema. Those mechanisms improve syntactic and schema reliability, but cited research reports still require provenance: claims should come from provided or retrieved sources. See Structured outputs and Strict tool use.

You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses the built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Production traces show the agent sometimes runs a workspace-changing Bash command before confirming the intended project root with Read or Grep, even though the system prompt says this check is required. What change would most reliably enforce the required ordering?


**A(정답)** . Add a PreToolUse prerequisite gate that denies Bash until the project root check has been recorded.

**설명** :
A PreToolUse gate runs after Claude has produced tool parameters but before the tool call is processed, so it can enforce ordering at the tool boundary. This makes the required check a programmatic prerequisite rather than a behavioral preference in the prompt.

**B** . Add few-shot examples showing the agent inspecting project paths before invoking Bash.

**설명** :
Examples can steer the model toward the desired pattern, especially when the task is ambiguous. They do not create a hard prerequisite that prevents the Bash call when the prior check is missing.

**C** . Add stronger system instructions requiring Read or Grep before any workspace-changing Bash command.

**설명** :
Clearer instructions can improve behavior, but they still rely on the model choosing to follow the workflow. The traces already show that prompt guidance is not sufficient for this ordering requirement.

**D** . Add a PostToolUse check that rejects unsafe Bash commands and asks Claude to retry.

**설명** :
A PostToolUse check runs after the tool has already executed, so it cannot prevent the original Bash action. It may provide feedback for future correction, but it is not the right control point for blocking the action before it happens.

### 전반적인 설명

When workflow ordering matters for tool use, the key design choice is whether the system needs programmatic enforcement or merely prompt-based guidance. A prompt can tell Claude to inspect the project root first, and examples can reinforce that pattern, but neither prevents a tool call when the model takes the wrong path.

A PreToolUse hook or application-level prerequisite gate sits at the boundary where Claude has proposed a tool call but the application has not executed it yet. That makes it the natural place to inspect the proposed Bash call and block it before execution, such as by denying the call and returning feedback when the required repository check has not been recorded.

Post-execution checks are useful for feedback and cleanup, but they cannot block the tool call that already ran. This distinction is why hooks are documented as programmatic control mechanisms that run at lifecycle points, contrasting with simply relying on the LLM to choose the desired action. See Claude Code hooks guide and Claude Code hooks reference.

You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. During evaluation, the synthesis agent receives a very long aggregated prompt containing subagent outputs in chronological order. Final reports consistently include findings from the earliest web-search results and the latest report instructions, but they omit several relevant document-analysis findings embedded deep in the aggregated input. What change would most directly improve report completeness without rerunning the research?

**A** . Add a final checklist at the end of the synthesis prompt requiring the agent to consider every provided finding.

**설명** :
A checklist at the end may help with instruction following, but it does not make buried evidence easier to attend to. The omitted findings are still located in a weak position within a long input, so the reliability issue remains.

**B** . Replace the middle findings with uncited topic summaries before passing them to the synthesis agent for report writing.

**설명** :
This may reduce token load, but it removes the source mappings needed for a cited synthesis. For research reports, losing provenance can make the final output less complete and less verifiable even if the prompt is shorter.

**C** . Raise the response length cap so the synthesis agent can include more findings and citations in the final report.

**설명** :
A larger output allowance only affects how much the model can generate after reading the input. It does not improve how reliably the model attends to relevant information placed deep inside a long prompt.

**D(정답)** . Move a concise findings-and-source map to the start of the synthesis prompt and keep detailed evidence under labeled sections.

**설명** :
Long inputs are more reliable when the most important information is positioned where the model is most likely to use it. A concise findings-and-source map at the beginning gives the synthesis agent a stable overview, while labeled sections preserve a path to detailed evidence.

### 전반적인 설명

Long-context systems should not assume that every token in a large prompt receives equal practical attention. The pattern described here matches the lost-in-the-middle effect: information near the beginning and end of long inputs is often used more reliably than information buried in the middle. See Context windows.

For a multi-agent research system, the coordinator should make the synthesis input position aware. Put a concise map of key findings, claim-source associations, and coverage areas near the beginning, then include detailed evidence under clear section headers. This does not guarantee perfect recall, but it makes the most important material easier for the synthesis agent to use.

Appending reminders, increasing output length, or replacing evidence with uncited summaries addresses adjacent symptoms rather than the main failure mode. The goal is to preserve provenance while arranging the prompt so critical findings are not hidden in the least reliable part of the context.

You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. Your /architectural-scan command asks Claude Code to investigate frontend state management, database access patterns, and test coverage before proposing a refactor. Logs show the main thread waits for the frontend subagent summary before launching the database subagent, then waits again before launching the test subagent, even though the three investigations are independent. What change best reduces this tool-call serialization without changing the analysis scope?


**A(정답)** . Have the main thread issue the independent Agent calls in one assistant turn, then return all matching tool_result blocks together in the next user message.

**설명** :
Independent investigations are a good fit for parallel subagent spawning because none of the subagents depends on another subagent's output. Emitting multiple Agent tool calls in one assistant turn lets the orchestrator run them concurrently, while grouping the matching tool_result blocks preserves the parallel tool-use pattern.

**B** . Return each subagent summary in a separate user message immediately after completion, and let the main thread continue once all summaries have arrived.

**설명** :
For multiple tool calls from one assistant turn, each tool_use block should receive a corresponding tool_result block together in the next user message. Sending separate user messages for each result is documented as the wrong format because it can reduce the model's future parallel tool use.

**C** . Keep one Agent call per assistant turn, wait for each subagent's final result, and mark each subagent as background before launching it.

**설명** :
Background subagents can affect whether the main conversation blocks while work runs, but this option still waits for each final result before issuing the next Agent call. That preserves the serialized launch pattern shown in the logs rather than using single-turn parallel tool use.

**D** . Set tool_choice.disable_parallel_tool_use to true, and ask the main thread to prioritize the shortest investigation before launching the others.

**설명** :
The disable_parallel_tool_use control is documented inside the tool_choice object, but setting it to true restricts parallel tool use. Disabling parallel tool use or prioritizing one investigation first would reinforce sequential behavior instead of improving concurrency.

### 전반적인 설명

Parallel subagent spawning is an application of parallel tool use: Claude can return several tool_use blocks in a single assistant turn with stop_reason: "tool_use". The API does not require a particular execution order, so the client or orchestrator can run independent calls concurrently and then provide the observations back to Claude.

In current Claude Code documentation, the subagent tool is named Agent, so new Claude Code workflows and agent definitions should use that name. The important design choice here is not merely whether a subagent runs in the foreground or background, but whether the coordinator emits independent subagent calls together rather than waiting for each result before launching the next one.

The response formatting is part of the reliability design. When several tool calls appear together, return one tool_result for each tool_use, all in the immediately following user message, and place those result blocks before any text. Splitting results into separate user turns introduces extra turns and is specifically called out as harmful to parallel tool use.

See Claude Code subagents, Parallel tool use, and Handle tool calls for the documented behavior and message-formatting rules.

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. After a schema update, three extraction failures appear together: vendor alias resolution, service-date normalization, and invoice total reconciliation. Each failure touches the same parser module and shared test fixtures, and fixing one in isolation has repeatedly broken another. What Claude Code workflow should this team use next?


**A(정답)** . Start plan mode with all failing fixtures, shared schema constraints, and the validation command.

**설명** :
This is correct because the failures are related and affect the same implementation plan. Giving Claude the full relevant context up front, then asking it to plan and verify, helps it account for cross-effects instead of optimizing one failure at a time.

**B** . Keep the current conversation and correct each remaining failure after every validation run.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because repeated correction on the same issue is a sign that the session needs a better prompt, not more incremental patching. Continuing in the same context can preserve misleading assumptions from earlier failed attempts.

**C** . Run separate direct edits for each failing fixture, clearing context between validation commands.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because the failures are not independent. Clearing context between each edit would hide interactions in the shared parser and make regressions more likely.

**D** . Combine the parser repair with unrelated downstream cleanup to optimize the full pipeline.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because mixing unrelated work into the same conversation creates unnecessary context load. Claude Code documentation identifies this kind of kitchen sink session as a failure pattern and recommends separating unrelated tasks.

### 전반적인 설명

Claude Code works best when the prompt matches the dependency structure of the work. When several failures share a parser, fixtures, and validation path, they should be presented together with the target behavior and a concrete verification command. This lets Claude reason about the whole change surface, choose a coherent implementation plan, and iterate against the same evidence the team uses to judge success.

For complex or cross-file changes, plan mode is appropriate because Claude can inspect the codebase and propose an approach before editing. The useful prompt is not just a list of complaints, it includes the symptoms, likely location, constraints, and how to verify the result. Anthropic's Claude Code guidance emphasizes precise initial prompts and asking Claude to run, test, compare, or verify as part of the same request, as described in Claude Code Best Practices.

The opposite pattern applies when work is unrelated or independent. A single long conversation that jumps among unrelated tasks fills the context with irrelevant material and can degrade results, because Claude Code's context contains conversation history, file contents, command outputs, memory, loaded skills, and instructions. The context model is described in How Claude Code Works, and the practical fix for unrelated tasks is to separate them, often using /clear or scoped non-interactive runs rather than cramming everything into one session.

## 질문 17

You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. During a large refactor, this team wants Claude Code to run a database-migration reviewer, API compatibility reviewer, and test-coverage reviewer in parallel. The team also wants one place to resolve conflicting findings and decide which follow-up work to run. Which orchestration design best matches Claude Code's subagent model?

**A** . Start each reviewer as an isolated subagent, rely on inherited main-thread history, and merge findings without a separate routing step.

**설명** :
Named subagents start fresh and isolated unless using the documented fork behavior. A reviewer cannot be assumed to know the main conversation history, prior file reads, or invoked skills unless the main agent includes that context in the delegation.

**B** . Let the reviewer subagents message each other directly, maintain a shared task list, and send the final plan after peer coordination.

**설명** :
Direct teammate-to-teammate messaging and shared task coordination describe agent teams, not Claude Code subagents. Subagents report results back to the main agent rather than coordinating peer-to-peer.

**C** . Omit Agent from the main agent tools, predefine reviewer prompts in CLAUDE.md, and let Claude choose reviewers implicitly.

**설명** :
Omitting Agent prevents the main agent from spawning subagents. CLAUDE.md can provide project context and instructions, but it does not replace the subagent spawning mechanism or central orchestration step.

**D(정답)** . Have the main agent spawn the reviewers with Agent, pass each reviewer its needed context, collect summarized results, and synthesize follow-ups centrally.

**설명** :
Claude Code subagents run in separate context windows and return summarized results to the caller. Keeping synthesis, conflict resolution, and follow-up routing in the main agent matches the documented hub and spoke subagent pattern.

### 전반적인 설명

Claude Code subagents implement a hub and spoke pattern: the main agent manages decomposition, delegates work, receives summarized results, and decides what to do next. A subagent is a specialized assistant inside a Claude Code session with its own context window, system prompt, tool access, and permissions, so the main agent must provide the context needed for that delegated task.

This differs from agent teams, where teammates can message each other directly and coordinate through a shared task list. In the subagent model, peer-to-peer coordination is the wrong mental model because results flow back to the caller, and the caller performs synthesis and error handling.

The current Claude Code spawning tool is Agent, with older Task references still supported as aliases. You can also restrict which subagents the main agent may spawn with syntax such as Agent(worker, researcher), which is useful when you want controlled orchestration rather than unbounded delegation. See Claude Code subagents and Claude Code agent teams.

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. This team is using Claude Code to update the extraction repository. Which task is the best fit for plan mode before implementation rather than asking Claude to make the change directly in default mode?


**A(정답)** . Have Claude explore the existing invoice extraction flow, then propose a migration plan for changing how ambiguous totals are represented.

**설명** :
This is a good fit for plan mode because the approach is uncertain and likely spans multiple parts of the codebase. Plan mode lets Claude research and propose a path before source files are edited, which supports review before implementation.

**B** . Have Claude review the small extractor helper, rename one local variable to the chosen name, and update immediate references.

**설명** :
A single local rename with a chosen target name is usually direct and low risk. Using plan mode for this kind of obvious edit slows the workflow without adding meaningful architectural review.

**C** . Have Claude open the known schema file, correct a misspelled field label, and apply the obvious one-line edit.

**설명** :
This is a small, clear, low-ambiguity change, so plan mode would add unnecessary overhead. A direct request in the normal workflow is more appropriate when the diff can be described in one sentence.

**D** . Have Claude inspect the already identified validation function, add one logging statement after failures, and save the narrow edit.

**설명** :
This task has a known location and a straightforward implementation. Plan mode is most useful when exploration and design review are needed, not when the requested edit is narrowly scoped.

### 전반적인 설명

Plan mode is useful when you want Claude Code to explore the repository, reason about alternatives, and produce a proposal before implementation. In this case, changing how ambiguous invoice totals are represented could affect parsing logic, schemas, fixtures, validation behavior, and downstream adapters, so reviewing the plan before edits reduces the chance of an accidental partial migration.

The documented distinction is not that plan mode is simply a different prompting style. Permission modes are operational controls, and plan mode lets Claude read files, run exploratory shell commands subject to the usual permission prompts, and write a plan without editing source files. For clear small tasks like typo fixes, log lines, or local renames, the best-practices guidance says to skip plan mode because it adds overhead. See Claude Code permission modes and Claude Code best practices.

You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. The coordinator completed an investigation yesterday and saved a session containing web-search outputs, document-analysis tool results, synthesis notes, and report-generation drafts. Since then, the document corpus was reindexed, several source documents were updated, and a reviewer corrected which prior findings remain valid. The team wants the next run to preserve only the valid analysis decisions while avoiding outdated observations from yesterday's tools. What should the coordinator do next?

**A** . Resume the saved session by ID and instruct the coordinator to disregard outdated tool results.

**설명** :
Resuming by session ID brings the full prior conversation history back into context, including previous tool calls and tool results. A prompt instruction to ignore stale blocks is weaker than excluding them from the session context in the first place.

**B** . Continue the most recent session in the current directory and rerun only the report-generation subagent.

**설명** :
Continuing the most recent session still loads the existing prior context for that directory. Rerunning only report generation does not refresh stale search and document observations that may affect the report's factual basis.

**C** . Fork the saved session and use the fork to explore a corrected report version.

**설명** :
Forking creates a new session ID, but it begins with a copy of the original session history. It preserves the old transcript for divergence, so it is not a clean way to exclude stale tool results.

**D(정답)** . Start a fresh session and inject a structured summary of validated findings, decisions, and sources to recheck.

**설명** :
Starting fresh avoids carrying stale web-search and document-analysis tool results back into the model context. Injecting structured application state preserves the useful decisions and validated findings without depending on the old session transcript.

### 전반적인 설명

Claude Agent SDK sessions preserve the full conversation history, including prompts, tool calls, tool results, and responses. That makes resume and continue useful when prior context is still valid, but risky when old environmental observations have changed because those stale blocks return to the model context.

When only selected state remains trustworthy, the more reliable pattern is to store that information as application state, such as validated findings, decisions, source identifiers, and known corrections, then pass it into a fresh session. This keeps the useful reasoning scaffold while forcing current tool calls to rebuild the evidence base. Forking is different from starting fresh because it copies existing session or conversation context before diverging.

See Anthropic's session guidance at Claude Agent SDK Sessions and the related CLI behavior for --continue and --resume at Claude Code CLI Usage.

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. During validation, an MCP tool detects that an extracted invoice date is impossible and that the stated line-item total does not match the extracted subtotal. The tool currently returns a normal result containing the text "validation failed," after which Claude sometimes repeats the same call and downstream systems sometimes treat the extraction as successful. What change would best improve recovery behavior?


**A(정답)** . Return a CallToolResult with isError set and structuredContent describing the error category, retryability, affected fields, and correction hint.

**설명** :
This makes the tool failure explicit while giving Claude and downstream systems machine-readable information for recovery. Validation errors should tell the agent what was wrong and whether a corrected retry is useful, rather than relying on ambiguous prose.

**B** . Return a JSON-RPC error for the tools/call request to report the validation failure at the protocol layer.

**설명** :
A schema validation failure in the document extraction is an application-level tool outcome, not necessarily a malformed MCP request. JSON-RPC errors are better reserved for protocol-level request failures; a domain validation failure should be reported through the tool result so the agent receives structured recovery context.

**C** . Expand the tool description with date and total formats so Claude is less likely to submit invalid arguments.

**설명** :
Better descriptions can improve tool selection and argument quality, but they do not communicate the outcome of a failed validation. The observed problem is that failures are being reported ambiguously after the tool runs.

**D** . Return a successful CallToolResult with an empty extraction and content text explaining that the document could not be validated.

**설명** :
This hides a failed validation behind a successful tool result, which can cause downstream systems to accept bad or missing data. A text warning alone is not reliable enough for automated recovery or routing.

### 전반적인 설명

MCP tool calls are made through tools/call, with the tool name and optional arguments supplied in the request. The response shape for tool execution is a CallToolResult, which includes content and can include structuredContent, making it possible to separate human-readable explanation from machine-readable metadata.

For extraction systems, validation failures should be explicit: set isError and include enough structured detail for the agent or application to decide whether to retry, correct inputs, route to human review, or stop. A useful validation error identifies the category, affected fields, whether retry is appropriate, and a concrete correction hint. Returning an empty successful extraction is an anti-pattern because it collapses two different states, valid empty result and failed validation, into the same downstream signal.

Use JSON-RPC errors for protocol-level problems with the request, not as the default way to report domain-specific validation failures from a tool. See the MCP Tools specification and Schema Reference for the documented tool call and result structures.

You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses the built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. A developer productivity team is building a Messages API tool-use implementation for codebase assistance. During testing, developers ask questions such as "find a simpler name for this helper" and "search your reasoning for edge cases," and Claude calls a repository grep tool or an MCP repository search tool even when no codebase lookup is needed. The tool descriptions already state that these tools are for inspecting repository contents or MCP-provided project data, and the request uses the default tool_choice behavior. The system prompt includes: "Whenever a user says find, search, locate, or look up, use a search tool before answering." What change should you make first?


**A(정답)** . Replace the broad keyword rule with a narrower instruction to use search tools only when repository or MCP data must be inspected.

**설명** :
This directly addresses the instruction that is expanding tool use beyond the intended boundaries. Tool descriptions are important, but system prompt wording is part of the instruction context that can steer when Claude uses tools, so broad keyword rules can override otherwise clear trigger boundaries.

**B** . Expand the repository grep and MCP tool descriptions with more examples of requests that should not invoke each tool.

**설명** :
Improving tool descriptions is useful when selection boundaries are vague or overlapping. In this case, the descriptions already establish the correct boundary, while the system prompt creates a conflicting keyword-based trigger that should be fixed first.

**C** . Set tool_choice to {"type":"any"} so Claude must choose the best available tool on every user turn.

**설명** :
This would make the overuse worse by requiring a tool call even when Claude could answer directly. If a tool call must be required for a specific Messages API workflow, tool_choice is the right mechanism, but it is not appropriate for ordinary conversational or reasoning requests.

**D** . Rename the search-oriented tools so their names no longer resemble common user words such as find or search.

**설명** :
Changing names does not remove the broad instruction telling Claude to use search tools for those user keywords. Tool names must be valid identifiers, but selection is guided by the user request, tool descriptions, and system instructions rather than simple name avoidance.

### 전반적인 설명

When tools are supplied through the Messages API, Claude does not rely on tool descriptions in isolation. Anthropic documents that tool use is influenced by the user request and the tool description, and the system prompt is also part of the constructed instruction context alongside tool definitions and tool configuration. A broad rule such as "always search when the user says find" can therefore shift tool-use boundaries even if the individual tool descriptions are well written.

With the default tool_choice behavior, Claude decides each turn whether a tool is needed. The better design is to keep the tool descriptions clear and make the system prompt preserve semantic intent, for example using repository grep or MCP search when repository contents or external project data must be inspected, not when a developer uses a common English word metaphorically. If a Messages API workflow truly requires a tool call, use tool_choice deliberately for that workflow rather than relying on broad keyword prompting.

See Tool use overview for how Claude decides when to use tools and how tool_choice changes that behavior, and Implement tool use for how tool definitions, user system prompts, and tool configuration are combined in the request context.

You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses the built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This team added a repository memory rule saying package publishing commands must include an approved ticket ID. In testing, Claude usually follows the rule, but occasionally runs a publishing command during broad automation requests without the ticket ID. The requirement is to prevent that command path while still allowing ordinary shell commands. What change best addresses this?

**A** . Disable Bash entirely and require all shell operations to use a custom MCP tool.

**설명** :
Removing Bash would prevent the publishing command, but it would also block ordinary shell commands that the requirement says should remain available. A narrower enforcement point is preferable when only one command pattern needs policy checks.

**B(정답)** . Add a PreToolUse hook for Bash that rejects publishing commands missing an approved ticket ID.

**설명** :
A PreToolUse hook can inspect a Bash tool call before it executes and block it when it violates a policy. This provides enforcement at the tool boundary rather than relying on Claude to remember and follow a contextual instruction.

**C** . Move the publishing rule into CLAUDE.md and rewrite it with stronger mandatory wording.

**설명** :
CLAUDE.md is loaded as context for Claude, not as enforced configuration. Stronger wording can improve compliance, but it cannot guarantee that a prohibited command will be blocked before execution.

**D** . Add few-shot examples showing Claude asking for a ticket before publishing packages.

**설명** :
Examples can help shape model behavior, especially for common workflows and edge cases. They still rely on probabilistic instruction following, so they are not the right control for a command that must be prevented.

### 전반적인 설명

When a tool action must be blocked regardless of what Claude decides to do next, use a tool-boundary control rather than only a prompt or memory instruction. A PreToolUse hook is designed to run before a tool call executes, which makes it appropriate for rejecting a risky Bash invocation that lacks required approval metadata.

CLAUDE.md, few-shot examples, and similar prompt instructions are useful for steering behavior, but they are still context. Claude Code memory is loaded into Claude's context rather than acting as an enforced policy layer. That distinction is central to safe agent design: prompts guide decisions, hooks enforce boundaries.

The best architecture keeps flexible tools available while adding precise controls where failures matter. Blocking all shell access would reduce capability more than necessary, while a targeted hook preserves normal developer productivity and rejects only the prohibited command pattern. See Claude Code hooks and Claude Code memory for the documented distinction between lifecycle-triggered automation and memory-based context.

You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. A subscription retailer's support platform team is reviewing its customer support resolution agent and finds that escalated support tickets often contain vague notes like "customer is upset about a refund". Human agents who receive these tickets cannot access the original chat, and downstream support tooling expects consistent handoff data. What implementation change best addresses the issue?


**A(정답)** . Define an escalate_to_human client tool whose input_schema requires customer_id, root_cause, refund_amount, and recommended_action.

**설명** :
This makes escalation an explicit application action with schema-defined arguments that the application can extract and use to create the ticket. Requiring the key handoff fields ensures the human agent receives the self-contained context needed without relying on the original transcript.

**B** . Create a /handoff slash command that asks the developer to paste the full conversation into the ticket body.

**설명** :
A slash command can automate a Claude Code workflow, but requiring a pasted transcript does not solve the need for structured, self-contained handoff data. It also depends on manual developer behavior rather than enforcing the fields at the application boundary.

**C** . Add a CLAUDE.md instruction telling Claude to write a complete escalation paragraph before finishing each support interaction.

**설명** :
CLAUDE.md can provide useful project context and behavioral guidance, but it does not enforce a parseable application-level handoff. Free-form prose can still omit fields or vary in structure, which is risky when downstream systems expect consistent data.

**D** . Configure tool_choice to force process_refund so refund arguments validate before any customer ticket is created.

**설명** :
Forcing a refund tool call does not create a structured escalation record for the human agent. The missing reliability requirement concerns the handoff fields in the support ticket, not only refund execution inputs.

### 전반적인 설명

When escalation creates or updates a support ticket, model it as a client tool such as escalate_to_human. Claude emits a structured tool_use request with JSON arguments, then the application extracts those arguments, performs the operation, and returns a tool_result. The tool definition should include a clear name, detailed description, and input_schema, with required fields for the handoff facts the human agent needs.

The important design judgment is to avoid treating a human handoff as ordinary chat text. Prompt instructions, project memory, and slash commands can improve workflows, but they do not provide the same reliability as schema-defined data passed through a tool boundary. The tool description should make the operational constraint explicit: the human agent will not have the transcript, so the summary must be self-contained. See Implement tool use.

You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses the built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This team is adding a CI command that reviews changed files and posts inline suggestions. The PR bot must receive a JSON object matching an application schema with fields for file, line, severity, and message, and it should fail rather than post malformed comments if Claude cannot produce valid data. The job also needs run metadata for accounting. Which implementation should they use?


**A(정답)** . Run Claude Code with `-p`, `--output-format json`, and `--json-schema`, then read the validated result from `structured_output`.

**설명** :
This uses print mode for CI and combines structured JSON metadata with schema-conforming output. The documented schema output appears in `structured_output`, while the JSON response can still include run metadata such as session and usage information.

**B** . Run Claude Code with `-p` and `--output-format stream-json`, then validate each streamed event as a review object.

**설명** :
`stream-json` is intended for newline-delimited JSON output during real-time streaming. It is not the documented mechanism for producing one final validated object that matches an application JSON Schema.

**C** . Run Claude Code with default text output, then instruct the prompt to return only schema-compliant JSON.

**설명** :
Prompt instructions can improve formatting, but they do not provide CLI-level schema validation. In a CI workflow that must avoid posting malformed comments, relying only on natural-language instructions is a weaker and less deterministic approach.

**D** . Run Claude Code with `-p` and `--output-format json`, then parse the review fields from the `result` value.

**설명** :
`--output-format json` controls the wrapper format returned by print mode, but it does not make the model answer conform to an application schema. The free-form answer is in `result`, so downstream parsing can still encounter prose or malformed application data.

For CI automation, start with claude -p or claude --print because print mode runs Claude Code non-interactively and exits after producing a result. --output-format json makes the CLI response machine-readable and includes metadata useful for automation and accounting, but the model's ordinary answer remains a free-form value in result.

When the downstream system needs an application object that matches a JSON Schema, add --json-schema together with --output-format json. The documented structured-output flow allows Claude Code to use tools during its workflow, then return a validated schema-conforming value at the end in structured_output. If validation cannot succeed within the retry behavior, the run should surface an error rather than silently returning malformed structured data.

This distinction matters in developer productivity tooling because CI bots should be conservative about posting comments, opening issues, or updating records. Use JSON output format for the CLI envelope and metadata, and use JSON Schema structured output for the application payload. See Run Claude Code programmatically for print mode and output-format behavior, and Structured outputs for validated schema-conforming output after agent workflows.

You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses the built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. During a manual orchestration test, Claude returns <code>stop_reason</code> <code>tool_use</code> with two tool requests, one for reading a file and one for searching related symbols. The application executes both operations, but the following Claude response does not incorporate the retrieved file contents or search matches. Which change should this team make to the loop?

**A** . Append a new assistant message summarizing both tool outputs, then request the next turn without the original tool requests.

**설명** :
Tool results are not returned as ordinary assistant summaries in the Messages API. Removing the original tool use blocks breaks the pairing between Claude's requested actions and the results your application executed.

**B** . Append two separate user messages, each containing one tool result, then request the next turn after both messages are added.

**설명** :
For parallel client tool calls, tool results should be returned together in a single user message. Splitting the results across separate user messages is documented as an incorrect pattern and can interfere with future parallel tool use.

**C** . Append a user text note describing both outputs, then place the tool result blocks after that note in the same message.

**설명** :
When a user message contains tool results, the tool result blocks must come before any text blocks. Placing explanatory text before tool results is invalid formatting and can cause the API to reject the request.

**D(정답)** . Append the assistant message with the tool requests, then append one user message containing both matching tool results before the next request.

**설명** :
This preserves the conversation state Claude needs to connect each tool result to the tool request that produced it. For multiple client tool calls from the same assistant turn, the results should be returned together in a single user message with matching tool use identifiers.

### 전반적인 설명

For client tools, Claude does not execute the operation itself. Claude emits structured tool_use blocks, your application runs the requested tools, and the next request must carry the results back as tool_result blocks so Claude can continue reasoning from the new information.

The important mental model is that the transcript is the state. A valid client-tool loop appends the assistant message that contained the tool_use blocks, then appends a new user message containing the corresponding tool_result blocks with matching tool_use_id values. Claude can then incorporate those results into the next turn because they are part of the conversation context.

Formatting matters because the API uses message structure, not a separate tool or function role, to associate actions and observations. When several client tool calls are issued in parallel, return all their results together in one user message, and place all tool_result blocks before any text blocks in that message.

See Handle tool calls for the required tool_use and tool_result structure, and Parallel tool use for returning multiple tool results together.

You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. Your /review command uses detailed review criteria and a fixed output template. It still behaves inconsistently on unfamiliar refactors: sometimes it flags harmless local conventions as defects, and other times it misses real defects that differ from the examples in the checklist. What prompt change is the best next step?

**A** . Add a CLAUDE.md rule that states the reviewer should be conservative, with no examples to avoid bias.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because vague instructions like being conservative leave too much room for inconsistent interpretation. Avoiding examples removes one of the strongest ways to demonstrate the expected format, tone, structure, and decision criteria.

**B** . Add a larger checklist that enumerates every pattern seen so far, with instructions to report only exact matches.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because an exhaustive checklist encourages brittle matching against known cases rather than adaptable judgment. It may reduce some false positives, but it will miss new defect patterns that do not exactly match the enumerated list.

**C** . Add several examples drawn from one recent refactor, with instructions to copy their wording and severity labels.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because examples from a single refactor can overrepresent accidental patterns in that change. Copying wording and labels may improve superficial consistency, but it does not teach the reviewer how to handle varied future cases.

**D(정답)** . Add diverse few-shot examples that show issue and non-issue reviews, with brief reasoning that marks the decision boundary.

**설명** :
This is correct because well-chosen examples teach Claude the judgment pattern behind the review, not just the surface wording of previous cases. Including both reportable and non-reportable cases helps establish boundaries so Claude can apply the criteria to novel refactors.

### 전반적인 설명

Few-shot or multishot prompting is useful when instructions alone do not reliably capture judgment. A few carefully selected examples can steer Claude’s output format, tone, and structure while improving accuracy and consistency, but the examples should demonstrate the underlying decision rule rather than act as a lookup table.

For a Claude Code review command, the strongest examples usually include both cases that should be reported and cases that should be ignored. That contrast helps Claude learn the boundary between a real defect and an acceptable local convention, so it can apply the same judgment to new refactors whose details were not pre-specified.

The main failure mode is overfitting to accidental patterns. A long exact-match checklist or several near-duplicate examples from one recent change can make the command brittle, while a vague rule such as “be conservative” does not provide enough behavioral signal. Anthropic’s prompting guidance describes few-shot or multishot examples as a reliable way to improve consistency, and the Cookbook illustrates that Claude can follow example patterns and apply them to new inputs. See Claude prompting best practices and Summarization guide.

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Validation runs show that the extractor still represents missing monetary amounts inconsistently, sometimes as null, sometimes as an empty string, sometimes as "N/A", and sometimes by omitting the field. A concise prose rule has already been added, but the same failure pattern continues. What should this team do next?

**A** . Replace the positive normalization rule with prohibited-output instructions that forbid empty strings and omitted fields.

**설명** :
Negative instructions describe what not to do but still leave room for inconsistent alternatives. A positive target format, reinforced with concrete examples, gives Claude a clearer pattern to imitate.

**B(정답)** . Add three to five tagged source snippet and expected JSON examples covering typical and edge-case missing values.

**설명** :
Concrete input and output examples are the strongest next step when a prose rule is being interpreted inconsistently. A small, relevant, diverse, and structured set of examples teaches the exact transformation boundary, including how edge cases should map into the JSON schema.

**C** . Expand the prose rule with additional missing-value synonyms and stronger language about required normalization.

**설명** :
Adding more prose can help when the original rule is incomplete, but the question states that a concise prose rule already exists and the model is still applying it inconsistently. More wording often increases ambiguity rather than demonstrating the exact output pattern.

**D** . Move the normalization requirement into user-level CLAUDE.md so every local Claude Code session loads it.

**설명** :
User-level CLAUDE.md is personal persistent context for Claude Code sessions, not an enforcement mechanism for a shared extraction behavior. It also would not reliably distribute the rule to the team or demonstrate the desired transformation in the extraction prompt.

### 전반적인 설명

When a model applies a transformation inconsistently, the most effective refinement is often not more abstract instruction, but concrete input/output examples. Examples show Claude the exact mapping you expect, such as a source phrase like Amount: N/A becoming {"amount": null}, and they clarify nearby edge cases such as blank fields, explicit zero values, ranges, and truly absent data.

Anthropic recommends examples as one of the most reliable ways to steer output format, tone, and structure, and recommends using a small set of relevant, diverse, structured examples. Wrapping them in descriptive XML tags such as <examples> and <example> helps separate examples from instructions and variable document input, reducing prompt ambiguity.

CLAUDE.md is useful persistent context for Claude Code, especially for project facts, commands, and concise conventions, but it is not an enforced runtime configuration. For a recurring extraction transformation, the behavior should be made explicit in the task prompt, skill, or extraction workflow, with examples that match the desired JSON schema.

See Anthropic's guidance on examples and XML structure in Claude prompting best practices, and Claude Code memory guidance in Claude Code memory.

You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses the built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This team built a PR-review helper around Claude Code. It runs after every push and posts inline GitHub comments, but later runs often repeat findings that were already raised in earlier runs. The team wants repeated reviews to remain useful without hiding issues that are still present. What should they change?

**A** . Switch follow-up reviews to manual requests so developers decide when repeated comments are worth generating.

**설명** :
Manual review requests can reduce how often reviews run, but they do not solve duplication within the review output. In managed Code Review, @claude review once starts a single review without subscribing future pushes, but it does not provide prior findings as context.

**B(정답)** . Persist previous PR findings and pass them into each rerun, instructing Claude to report only new or still-unaddressed issues.

**설명** :
This gives each review run the state needed to distinguish resolved, still-open, and newly introduced findings. It reduces duplicate inline comments while still allowing Claude to surface issues that remain relevant after later commits.

**C** . Deduplicate solely by matching file path and line number before posting follow-up comments.

**설명** :
Matching only file paths and line numbers is brittle because code movement can shift an unresolved defect to a new location. It can also suppress distinct issues that happen to appear on the same line after edits.

**D** . Ignore every file that had a prior review comment so follow-up runs focus only on untouched files.

**설명** :
File-level suppression hides useful findings when a later commit introduces a new defect in a previously reviewed file. It also prevents Claude from checking whether an earlier issue is still present and worth reporting.

### 전반적인 설명

Repeated PR review runs need a small amount of review state, otherwise each run behaves like an isolated analysis and may restate issues already discussed. Persisting prior findings for the PR and passing them into the next review prompt lets Claude compare the current diff against earlier feedback, then classify findings as new, resolved, or still unaddressed.

The practical goal is not to suppress all old findings. It is to avoid duplicate comments while preserving visibility for defects that still matter. A file-level blocklist or line-number-only filter treats comments as text artifacts rather than engineering findings, so it can miss semantic duplicates, unresolved defects that moved, or new problems in previously reviewed files.

Anthropic's managed Claude Code Review documentation describes review modes such as running after every push and notes that push-triggered reviews can catch new issues as a PR evolves and auto-resolve threads when fixed. It also describes REVIEW.md as review-specific guidance for the review pipeline, rather than a separate deduplication flag. See Claude Code Review.

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Validation logs show the JSON is syntactically valid, but the review queue is flooded with invoice anomaly flags. Many flags involve harmless formatting differences, while some arithmetic mismatches are missed. The current instruction says, "Find any questionable totals and flag them for review." What prompt change would most directly improve consistency?


**A(정답)** . Replace the vague flagging instruction with measurable rules for when parsed line items conflict with stated totals.

**설명** :
This directly turns a subjective instruction into a testable decision rule. Clear criteria reduce inconsistent interpretations and make the output easier to evaluate against expected behavior.

**B** . Add a stronger instruction to be conservative and flag only high-confidence total anomalies for reviewers.

**설명** :
This still depends on subjective terms like conservative and high-confidence. Those terms do not define the evidence threshold Claude should apply, so different cases can still be interpreted inconsistently.

**C** . Raise the temperature so Claude considers more possible interpretations of each invoice layout.

**설명** :
Higher temperature increases variation, which is usually the opposite of what extraction and classification tasks need. The problem is unclear criteria, not a lack of creative interpretations.

**D** . Require Claude to explain every suspected total anomaly before writing the final JSON output.

**설명** :
Explanations may help reviewers understand a decision, but they do not define the decision boundary. The system can still produce too many or too few flags if the underlying criteria remain vague.

### 전반적인 설명

For extraction systems, a syntactically valid JSON object is not enough. The model also needs explicit decision criteria for fields that involve judgment, such as whether a document should be flagged for review.

Instructions like questionable totals, be conservative, or high confidence leave too much room for interpretation. A better prompt states the observable condition that triggers the flag, for example that the calculated sum of parsed line items conflicts with the stated total, while harmless layout variations should not be treated as anomalies by themselves.

Anthropic's prompting guidance emphasizes clear, explicit instructions, including desired output, format, constraints, and sequential steps when completeness matters. Its evaluation guidance similarly recommends defining success criteria that are specific and measurable, rather than relying on vague goals that are hard to test at scale.

See Prompting best practices and Define success criteria for the underlying guidance.

You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. After a long refactor-planning conversation yesterday, a developer captured the Claude Code session ID in an environment variable named `$session_id`. They need to continue that specific prior conversation from a terminal command while also sending the first follow-up prompt. Which action should they take?

**A** . Run `claude -p "Continue the $session_id investigation from yesterday."`

**설명** :
This sends the captured session ID as ordinary prompt text rather than using it as a CLI resumption target. Claude Code would start from the current invocation context instead of loading the prior conversation.

**B** . Run `claude -p "Continue the refactor investigation from yesterday." --continue`

**설명** :
This uses continuation behavior rather than selecting the specific session ID that matters here. If another conversation was more recent, this can continue the wrong context for the refactor work.

**C** . Start `claude`, paste `$session_id`, then ask it to continue yesterday's investigation.

**설명** :
This treats the session ID as conversational content rather than a command-line selector. Providing an ID inside the chat does not by itself restore the previous messages, tool observations, or decisions.

**D(정답)** . Run `claude -p "Continue the refactor investigation from yesterday." --resume "$session_id"`

**설명** :
This resumes the specific prior Claude Code session by its captured session ID and sends the next prompt in the same command. The documented CLI surface supports `--resume` and its short alias `-r` for resuming a specific session by ID.

### 전반적인 설명

Claude Code supports resuming a specific prior conversation from the CLI with --resume or -r. When the application has captured the session ID, passing that ID to --resume is the direct way to select the exact conversation rather than relying on recency or natural language instructions.

The important reliability distinction is between session selection and prompt content. A session identifier must be supplied to the CLI resumption flag so Claude Code can load the previous conversation context. Putting the identifier into the prompt only tells Claude about a string, it does not make the CLI restore that prior session.

For long code investigations, explicit resumption helps avoid context drift. Continuing the wrong conversation can cause Claude to rely on unrelated plans, stale assumptions, or observations from a different codebase task. See Claude Code CLI usage for the documented command-line flags.

You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. This team wants to run nightly pull request reviews through the Message Batches API. Each review may require an application-hosted client tool, run_repo_checks, that executes local linters and unit tests before Claude writes final feedback. Which design best handles this workflow?

**A** . Submit the review prompts as batch items, set tool_choice to run_repo_checks, and rely on the batch worker to run the client tool before returning final feedback.

**설명** :
Forcing a client tool can make Claude request that tool, but it does not make Anthropic infrastructure execute application-hosted code. The batch worker cannot run a local linter or unit test tool that belongs to the developer's application.

**B** . Submit the review prompts as batch items, replace run_repo_checks with web_search, and rely on server-tool execution to validate the local repository.

**설명** :
Server tools can run within batch requests, but web_search is not a substitute for executing local repository checks. This confuses the documented server-tool capability with the separate requirement to run application-hosted client tools against the codebase.

**C(정답)** . Submit the review prompts as batch items, retrieve any tool_use results by custom_id, run the requested client tools, and send follow-up requests with tool_result blocks.

**설명** :
This matches the documented lifecycle for client tools: Claude can request a tool, but the developer application must execute it and return tool_result blocks in a later request. In batch processing, results are retrieved after asynchronous processing, so the client-tool continuation has to happen after the batch item returns.

**D** . Submit one batch item containing the prompt, a predicted tool_result block, and the final review instructions so Claude can complete the loop in one request.

**설명** :
A tool_result is a response to a specific tool_use request and must correspond to the tool call Claude actually made. Predicting a tool result before executing the requested client tool breaks the tool-use lifecycle and risks fabricating repository check output.

### 전반적인 설명

The key distinction is between client tools and server tools. A client tool is executed by the developer's application: Claude returns stop_reason: "tool_use" with tool_use blocks, then the application runs the tool and sends a later user message containing matching tool_result blocks. That lifecycle is described in Handle tool calls.

The Message Batches API can batch many standard Messages API requests, including requests that use tools, and each batch item is tracked with a custom_id. But a single batched request is still processed asynchronously as an independent request, so your application cannot execute a local client tool in the middle of that same request and feed the result back before the item completes. See Batch processing for how batch requests and results work.

This does not mean batch processing broadly lacks tool support. Anthropic documents that server tools run on Anthropic infrastructure and can be used in batch requests, which is different from application-hosted client tools such as local linters or unit tests. The server-tool overview is available at Tool use overview.

You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses the built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. During an automated refactor, an `Edit` call fails because the supplied `old_string` appears multiple times in the same source file. The intended change is a one-off modification to the file's final content, not a replacement of every matching snippet. After the system has tried to make the exact `old_string` unique with surrounding context and can construct the full desired file contents, what should it do next to make the modification reliably?

**A** . Use Grep to choose the target line, then call Edit with the same non-unique `old_string`.

**설명** :
`Grep` can help find occurrences, but `Edit` still requires the supplied `old_string` to appear exactly once. Selecting a line outside the `Edit` call does not make the same non-unique replacement string valid.

**B** . Retry Edit with `replace_all: true` so every matching snippet is updated consistently.

**설명** :
`replace_all: true` is appropriate only when every occurrence should be changed. The situation states that the intended change is not a replacement of every matching snippet, so this would risk modifying code that should remain unchanged.

**C** . Retry Edit with a regex-style `old_string` that matches the desired occurrence more flexibly.

**설명** :
`Edit` performs exact string replacement, not regex or fuzzy matching. A regex-style pattern would not solve the uniqueness requirement and could fail because the `old_string` must appear exactly as written.

**D(정답)** . Read the current file, construct the complete desired file contents, then overwrite it with Write.

**설명** :
This is a reasonable last-resort strategy once a more specific exact `old_string` cannot reliably identify one occurrence and the system can produce the full final file content. `Write` overwrites an existing file with full supplied content after the file has been read in the current conversation, so it avoids relying on the ambiguous `Edit` match.

### 전반적인 설명

Claude Code's Edit tool is designed for targeted exact replacements. Before an edit applies, Claude must have read the file in the current conversation, the old_string must match exactly, and that old_string must appear exactly once. When a repeated snippet causes the failure, the documented first-line fix is to provide a longer exact old_string with enough surrounding context to identify the intended occurrence, or to use replace_all: true only when every occurrence should change.

This question adds the extra condition that the system has already tried to make the exact match unique and can construct the full desired file contents. Under those constraints, using Read followed by Write is a whole-file overwrite strategy, not a patch operation and not the documented first response to every non-unique Edit failure. It is reliable only because the system supplies the complete final content after reading the current file, rather than asking Edit to disambiguate a repeated snippet.

The distractors fail for different reasons. replace_all: true changes every occurrence, which conflicts with a one-off modification. Regex-style matching and external line selection do not satisfy Edit's exact, unique old_string requirement. See the official Claude Code tools reference for the documented behavior of Read, Edit, and Write.

You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. A new developer says Claude Code is not applying the repository’s TypeScript and testing conventions. The senior engineer can reproduce the conventions on their own machine, but the new developer cannot, and the team is unsure whether the relevant instruction files are actually visible in the new developer's session. What should you do first to diagnose the configuration hierarchy issue?

**A** . Run /status in the new developer's session and inspect the Setting sources line.

**설명** :
The /status command helps diagnose settings layers, such as user, project local, shared project, or managed settings. It does not list every loaded CLAUDE.md instruction file, so it is not the best first check for missing memory instructions.

**B** . Copy the senior engineer's user-level CLAUDE.md into the new developer's home directory.

**설명** :
User-level CLAUDE.md files are personal instructions for one developer, not the correct place for team-shared conventions. Copying them manually would create drift and would not establish a version-controlled project configuration.

**C** . Place the team conventions in .claude/settings.local.json on the new developer's machine.

**설명** :
.claude/settings.local.json is a local, non-shared settings file, not the normal home for team instruction text. It is also a settings mechanism rather than the CLAUDE.md memory mechanism used for project guidance.

**D(정답)** . Run /memory in the new developer's session and inspect the loaded instruction files.

**설명** :
The /memory command is the right diagnostic tool for visibility of Claude Code memory files. It shows which CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.local.md instruction files are loaded in the current session, so a missing project instruction file immediately explains why Claude cannot follow it.

### 전반적인 설명

When Claude Code appears to ignore project guidance, first distinguish memory files from settings files. The /memory command is designed for this diagnostic path because it shows which CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.local.md files are loaded in the current session. If an expected file is absent from that list, Claude cannot see those instructions in that session.

User-level instructions in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md are personal and apply only to that developer. Team conventions should live in a project-level CLAUDE.md or .claude/CLAUDE.md file that is committed to the repository. By contrast, /status is useful for settings source diagnosis, and .claude/settings.local.json is intentionally local and not shared. See the official Claude Code memory documentation and Claude Code settings documentation.

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. In testing, the system reviews a 30-file document packet by sending every source file and every extracted JSON object to one review prompt. The reviewer often misses file-specific extraction errors and sometimes returns contradictory conclusions about packet-level totals. The team also needs intermediate review artifacts that can be logged and evaluated. What should it do?


**A(정답)** . Use explicit prompt chaining with file-level review calls, then run a separate integration call over the local findings.

**설명** :
This approach breaks the review into smaller, inspectable steps, which reduces attention dilution from large contexts. The final integration call can focus on cross-file consistency after each file has already received focused local analysis.

**B** . Use one larger review call that includes all files, schemas, prior notes, and stricter checking instructions.

**설명** :
Adding more material to the same prompt does not address the underlying attention problem. Large contexts can degrade recall and accuracy, so a bigger prompt may preserve all content while still making the review less reliable.

**C** . Use repeated full-packet review calls at low temperature, then keep only findings that appear in multiple runs.

**설명** :
Repeated runs can reveal instability, but they do not create a structured local-then-global review process. Filtering for repeated findings may also discard rare but valid extraction errors that only one run detects.

**D** . Use one review call that asks Claude to critique its own findings before returning the final issue list.

**설명** :
Self-critique can improve some outputs, but it does not expose intermediate artifacts for each file. It also keeps the entire review inside a single broad context, so file-level errors can still be missed.

### 전반적인 설명

For large review tasks, the practical design issue is not only whether the model can fit the inputs in the context window. Anthropic documents context rot, where accuracy and recall can degrade as token count grows, so curating and structuring context remains important even with large context windows. A single prompt containing every file, every schema, and every extracted object can cause local details to compete with global consistency checks.

Explicit prompt chaining is the documented pattern for breaking a task into sequential API calls when you need visible intermediate outputs or a controlled pipeline. In this case, file-level review calls produce auditable local findings, such as missing fields, malformed values, or unsupported extracted claims. A later integration call can then compare the accepted local findings across files, such as checking packet-level totals or resolving contradictions, without also having to rediscover every local issue.

This does not mean every multi-step task should be chained. Anthropic notes that current Claude models can handle many multi-step tasks internally, so chaining is most justified when the system needs to log, evaluate, branch, or enforce a fixed review structure. Here, the need for intermediate artifacts and the observed degradation from a large single review make explicit chaining the better engineering tradeoff.

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. The extraction coordinator has specialized agents for table parsing, clause extraction, and schema repair, but its SDK configuration only auto-approves file inspection tools. It keeps performing all extraction work itself instead of delegating focused subtasks. What change should this team make?


**A(정답)** . Add Agent to the coordinator's allowedTools or allowed_tools configuration.

**설명** :
The current documented tool for spawning a subagent is Agent, and the SDK examples include Agent in allowedTools or allowed_tools when subagent invocation should be auto-approved. This lets the coordinator invoke subagents without falling into a permission prompt for that tool.

**B** . Set permissionMode to dontAsk while leaving the coordinator tools unchanged.

**설명** :
Using dontAsk can help lock down permissions, but it does not make an omitted spawning tool available for auto-approved use. If Agent is not allowed in the relevant configuration, the coordinator still lacks the documented path for subagent invocation.

**C** . Force tool_choice to the JSON schema extraction tool for each document.

**설명** :
Forcing a specific extraction tool can be useful for structured output, but it addresses tool selection for extraction, not subagent orchestration. It would push the coordinator toward one tool call rather than enabling delegation to separate specialist agents.

**D** . Add each subagent name directly to the coordinator's allowedTools configuration.

**설명** :
Subagent names are not the tool that performs the spawn operation. The coordinator invokes the Agent tool, which then routes the prompt to the selected subagent configuration.

### 전반적인 설명

In current Claude Code and Claude Agent SDK documentation, the tool used to spawn a subagent is Agent. The documentation notes that Task was renamed to Agent, with older references still supported as aliases, but new configurations should use the current tool name.

For an SDK coordinator that should invoke subagents without an approval prompt, include Agent in allowedTools for TypeScript or allowed_tools for Python. This matters because subagents are separate agent instances with fresh context, and the parent communicates the subtask through the Agent tool prompt rather than by automatically sharing its full conversation history.

Be careful not to overinterpret allowedTools as a complete security boundary by itself. The permissions documentation explains that it auto-approves listed tools, while unlisted tools may fall through to the configured permission mode or callback unless blocked or denied, so locked-down designs should combine allow settings with an appropriate permission mode.

**A** . Use the Message Batches API for the merge gate, and use POST /v1/messages for the weekly audit to preserve output ordering.

**설명** :
This reverses the appropriate latency tradeoff. Batch output can be returned in any order and should be correlated with custom_id values, while the blocking merge gate should use the regular Messages API.

**B** . Submit both workflows through the Message Batches API, and poll batch status until each pass or fail result is available.

**설명** :
This misapplies batch processing to a blocking workflow. Message Batches are asynchronous, results are available when processing completes, and batches can take up to 24 hours before final result availability or expiration.

**C** . Use streamed Messages API calls for both workflows, and run the weekly audit as many concurrent streamed requests.

**설명** :
Streaming can reduce perceived latency for an individual Messages response, but it is still the synchronous Messages API response path. It does not provide the cost and operational fit of the Message Batches API for high-volume, latency-tolerant audits.

**D(정답)** . Use POST /v1/messages for the merge gate, and submit the weekly audit through the Message Batches API with custom_id values.

**설명** :
This matches the latency profile of each workflow. The merge gate is blocking and needs an immediate response, while the weekly audit is high-volume asynchronous work that can tolerate delayed completion and should use custom_id values to correlate unordered batch results.

### 전반적인 설명

The key design choice is matching the API surface to the workflow's latency requirement. A pull request gate is a blocking workflow, so it should call POST /v1/messages and make the merge decision from the returned Message rather than waiting on an asynchronous batch job.

The weekly audit has a different shape: it is large, repetitive, and reviewed later. The Message Batches API is designed for asynchronous high-volume work, processes standard Messages requests, and is discounted, but it trades away immediate result availability. Anthropic documents that most batches complete in less than 1 hour, while results are available when all messages complete or after 24 hours, whichever comes first.

Streaming is not a substitute for batch processing. Setting stream: true streams an individual Messages response incrementally, but batch requests do not stream token-by-token and return results as a file. Because batch results can be returned in any order, production audit pipelines should include custom_id values to map each result back to its input report.

See the Messages API reference, the Message Batches API guide, and the Messages streaming guide.

You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. This team adds a custom MCP tool that creates issue-tracker tickets from stack traces. The ticketing service rejects a malformed project key, and the adapter must send the tool result back through the Messages API so Claude can recover. What should the adapter return?

**A** . Return a tool_result with is_error: true and content set to a generic string such as "Operation failed, try again later."

**설명** :
This uses the documented is_error field, but it withholds the recovery information Claude needs. A malformed project key is a validation failure, so the result should explain the expected format and whether retrying with corrected input is appropriate.

**B** . Abort the tool call with an uncaught exception and rely on Claude Code logs to show the ticketing service response.

**설명** :
An uncaught exception usually deprives Claude of structured information it can reason over. Returning an explicit tool_result keeps the agent loop intact and lets Claude decide whether to correct input, retry, or ask the user.

**C(정답)** . Return a tool_result with is_error: true and JSON content containing errorCategory, isRetryable, a clear message, and a suggested valid key format.

**설명** :
The Messages API recognizes is_error: true on a tool_result block as the signal that tool execution failed. Putting structured recovery metadata in the content gives Claude enough information to fix the project key and retry appropriately.

**D** . Return a tool_result with is_error omitted and JSON content containing no_ticket_created, message, and candidate project keys.

**설명** :
Omitting is_error makes the result look like an ordinary successful tool response. That hides the operational distinction between a failed ticket creation and a successful lookup with empty or partial information.

### 전반적인 설명

Tool errors should preserve two layers of meaning. The protocol-level signal tells Claude that the tool execution failed, and for the Messages API that signal is is_error: true on the tool_result block. The application-level details, such as errorCategory, isRetryable, a human-readable message, and a suggestion, belong in the result content so the model has actionable recovery context.

This separation matters because Claude cannot reliably infer whether to retry, correct input, escalate, or explain a policy failure from a generic error like “operation failed.” A validation error such as a malformed project key is often recoverable if the tool explains the expected format, while permission or business-rule failures should usually lead to escalation or user-facing explanation rather than repeated calls. The anti-pattern is to hide failures as successful empty results, since that causes the agent to reason from false premises.

Anthropic documents tool_result blocks with tool_use_id, optional content, and optional is_error, and shows is_error: true as the way to indicate that tool execution resulted in an error. See Handle tool calls.

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. During pilot testing, one submitter writes, "Stop the automated review and send this document to a person," even though the missing field is easy to extract. Another submitter writes, "The invoice date is missing, can you fix it?" and the source document contains a clear date. What escalation policy should this team implement?

**A** . Score the submitter's frustration, and escalate only when sentiment exceeds a fixed threshold.

**설명** :
Sentiment is an unreliable proxy for whether escalation is required. A calm user can explicitly request a human, while a frustrated user may still have a straightforward issue the system can resolve.

**B** . Attempt automated repair first, and escalate only if validation fails after the repair attempt.

**설명** :
This ignores the submitter's explicit request for a person by making escalation conditional on system failure. Validation results are useful for quality control, but they should not override a direct human escalation request.

**C** . Ask Claude for a confidence score, and escalate only when confidence falls below the review threshold.

**설명** :
Self-reported confidence is not a dependable substitute for explicit escalation criteria. The system may be confident on easy corrections, but that does not justify ignoring a direct request for human review.

**D(정답)** . Route explicit human requests directly to review, and offer automated repair for straightforward correction requests.

**설명** :
An explicit request for a human should be honored immediately, even if the system could likely resolve the issue. When the user has not demanded escalation and the issue is within the system's capability, the system can offer or perform the straightforward resolution.

### 전반적인 설명

Escalation logic should distinguish between user intent and task difficulty. If a customer or submitter explicitly asks for a human, the system should route the case to human review immediately rather than trying to prove it can solve the issue first.

For straightforward issues where the user has not asked for a person, such as a clearly visible missing date or amount, it is appropriate to offer automated correction and validation. This preserves automation benefits while respecting the boundary where the user has chosen human review.

Sentiment thresholds and model confidence scores are weaker signals than explicit escalation criteria. They can support triage, but they should not replace clear rules for cases such as direct human requests, policy gaps, ambiguous source documents, or inability to make progress.

For structured extraction systems, combine this escalation policy with schema validation and tool-based structured output so routine cases can be handled reliably. See Anthropic's Tool use documentation for how tool schemas can support reliable structured outputs.

You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. During a regulated-topic run, the report-generation subagent sometimes calls an MCP tool that publishes a draft before the coordinator has verified that every major claim has a source mapping. The team needs a deterministic control that prevents the publishing tool from executing unless the citation manifest is present. What change should they make?

**A** . Add a coordinator instruction that tells every subagent to verify the citation manifest before publishing.

**설명** :
Prompt instructions can improve behavior, but they do not deterministically prevent a tool call from being made. When the requirement is to block a regulated publishing action before it happens, relying only on model compliance is an anti-pattern.

**B(정답)** . Configure a PreToolUse hook for the publishing tool that blocks calls missing the required citation manifest.

**설명** :
A PreToolUse hook runs before the tool call executes, so it is the appropriate place to enforce a rule that must prevent a side effect. Because the hook can block the call, it provides deterministic enforcement beyond what a prompt instruction can provide.

**C** . Add the publishing MCP tool to allowedTools so approved tools can run without prompts.

**설명** :
The allowedTools setting auto-approves specified tools without prompting, rather than enforcing per-call compliance rules. It does not inspect each outgoing publishing call and block only the ones that fail the citation-manifest gate.

**D** . Configure a PostToolUse hook for the publishing tool that rejects outputs missing the required citation manifest.

**설명** :
A PostToolUse hook runs only after a tool call has succeeded, so it is too late to prevent the publishing side effect. It can be useful for follow-up processing or feedback, but not for blocking an outgoing tool call before execution.

### 전반적인 설명

When a tool call has an external side effect, such as publishing a report, the control point must sit before the tool executes. A PreToolUse hook is designed for that lifecycle moment: it intercepts an outgoing tool call and can block it when the call violates a policy, such as missing required provenance metadata.

This is different from using a PostToolUse hook, which runs after a tool succeeds. Post-execution hooks are useful for processing results or giving feedback, but they cannot prevent the original side effect from occurring. Similarly, coordinator or subagent prompts can guide behavior, but they remain probabilistic and are weaker than code-level enforcement for compliance gates.

In a multi-agent research system, provenance requirements should be represented as structured state that the coordinator can verify, then enforced at the boundary where risky actions occur. Anthropic documents hooks as Claude Code lifecycle mechanisms, with Agent SDK support through agent options, and identifies PreToolUse as the event that fires before tool execution and can block calls. See Hooks.

You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses the built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. During a long legacy-system investigation, the main conversation repeatedly fills with file listings, search hits, and test logs. The lead engineer wants the main agent to keep coordinating the architecture understanding without losing important context to verbose exploration output. What change best addresses this problem?

**A** . Use a general-purpose subagent for discovery, and return complete file excerpts to the main conversation.

**설명** :
A general-purpose subagent can handle complex tasks, but returning complete excerpts defeats the purpose of isolating verbose output. Large detailed returns can still consume significant main-context space, even when the work happened inside a subagent.

**B(정답)** . Delegate code search and file discovery to the Explore subagent, and return concise findings to the main conversation.

**설명** :
This uses Claude Code subagents for their intended context-management purpose: moving high-volume exploration into a separate context window. The main conversation receives only the relevant summary, so it can preserve high-level coordination and architecture reasoning.

**C** . Run Grep, Glob, Read, and Bash in the main conversation, and compact after each large discovery pass.

**설명** :
Compacting can reduce accumulated context, but it does not prevent verbose outputs from entering the main conversation first. It also risks losing nuance through summarization when the better design is to isolate the exploration before it floods the main context.

**D** . Create a fork for each investigation branch, and inherit the full parent conversation before searching files.

**설명** :
A fork inherits the parent conversation, so it does not provide the same input-context isolation as a normal named subagent. Forks can isolate their own tool calls and final result, but they are not the best choice when the goal is to keep verbose exploration out of the main coordination context.

### 전반적인 설명

Claude Code subagents are designed for task-specific workflows and context management. Each normal named subagent runs in its own context window with its own system prompt, tool access, and permissions, so high-volume operations such as code search, documentation lookup, test runs, and log processing do not have to flood the main conversation.

For codebase exploration, the built-in Explore subagent is a strong fit because it is read-only and intended for file discovery, code search, and codebase exploration. The important design move is not merely to call another agent, but to have that agent return a concise summary or structured findings back to the main conversation. If every subagent returns long file excerpts or raw logs, the main context can still fill up quickly.

Compaction is useful during long Claude Code sessions, but it is a cleanup mechanism rather than an isolation strategy. Forks are also different from normal named subagents because they inherit the parent conversation, which makes them less appropriate when input-context isolation is the primary goal. See Create custom subagents for the documented behavior and recommended use cases.

You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. A policy research team plans to process 60,000 research topics overnight as independent Messages API report-generation requests submitted through the Message Batches API. A pilot sample shows that the report-generation prompt sometimes omits required report sections and sometimes emits JSON metadata that downstream parsers reject. What is the best next step before submitting the full workload?

**A** . Submit the full Message Batch first, inspect the ended results for validation and quality failures, then resubmit only the errored and low-scoring research topics with a revised prompt.

**설명** :
This treats the batch as the evaluation mechanism, which increases the chance of expensive rework. Batch request validation happens asynchronously, and validation errors are returned only after the batch has ended, so preventable issues may not be visible until late in the process.

**B** . Run the Prompt improver on the report-generation prompt, accept the generated version as the production prompt, then submit the batch with unchanged grading and no scenario-specific test set.

**설명** :
The Prompt improver can help enhance a prompt template, but it is not a substitute for measuring the new prompt on realistic task examples. Anthropic recommends providing feedback and examples when using it, and any changed prompt should still be evaluated before broad use.

**C(정답)** . Turn the workflow into a prompt template, run representative edge-case evals with the same structured-output request shape, refine and re-run the prompt, then batch only after a synchronous dry run succeeds.

**설명** :
This approach addresses both quality and parseability before scale-out. It uses an evaluation loop to improve the prompt against realistic cases, preserves the intended structured-output request shape, and follows the recommended practice of dry-running a single request shape before creating a large batch.

**D** . Increase the report-generation schema strictness and force the report tool for every request, then rely on schema validation to handle coverage and citation-quality issues during batching.

**설명** :
Structured outputs can improve parseability and validate tool parameters, but they do not by themselves prove that the report covers every required section or uses citations appropriately. Schema enforcement should be combined with prompt evaluation, not used as the only quality-control step before a large batch.

### 전반적인 설명

For large-volume work, the safest mental model is: evaluate before you scale. Anthropic’s evaluation guidance frames prompt engineering as defining success criteria, building evaluations that resemble the real task distribution, iterating on the prompt, validating the result, and only then shipping it into broader use.

In this case, the pilot surfaced two different failure classes: missing required content and rejected structured metadata. A representative eval suite helps expose section-coverage and citation-quality patterns across many realistic topics, while using the same documented structured-output or tool-use request shape tests the parseability path the batch will actually use.

The Message Batches API is designed for asynchronous, latency-tolerant processing of independent Messages API requests, but it is not a good place to discover preventable request-shape problems. Anthropic notes that batch request validation occurs asynchronously and recommends dry-running a single request shape with the synchronous Messages API first. The Console Evaluation tool and prompt templates are useful because they separate fixed instructions from variables such as {{topic}}, making it easier to compare prompt versions across test cases before submitting thousands of independent requests.

Relevant documentation: Define success criteria, Evaluation tool, Prompt generator, Structured outputs, and Batch processing.

You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. The coordinator sometimes delegates to the report-generation subagent before the document-analysis subagent has returned evidence excerpts and source metadata. The resulting reports are well written but contain claims that cannot be traced back to the underlying sources. What change would most effectively prevent this failure mode?

**A** . Add stronger coordinator instructions that report generation must occur only after all evidence metadata is available.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because prompt instructions can improve behavior but do not guarantee ordering when the model is deciding the next action. The observed failure requires a control mechanism that blocks premature delegation rather than merely discouraging it.

**B(정답)** . Add an orchestration-level prerequisite that rejects report-generation delegation until required results and source mappings are present.

**설명** :
This is correct because the required workflow ordering is a deterministic orchestration concern, not just a writing preference. In an Agent SDK design, the coordinator can validate shared state or use enforcement logic before allowing the report-generation subagent to run.

**C** . Force the report-generation tool with tool_choice so Claude always selects the named reporting step.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because forcing a named tool requires use of that tool, but it does not validate that earlier workflow steps have completed. It could make premature report generation more likely by emphasizing the final step rather than enforcing prerequisites.

**D** . Increase the coordinator's iteration limit so the loop has more chances to request missing evidence.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because the failure is not caused by the agent stopping before it has enough iterations. More iterations do not prevent the coordinator from choosing the report-generation step before the required evidence has been gathered.

### 전반적인 설명

When a multi-step agent workflow has a required ordering, use programmatic enforcement in the orchestration layer for the parts that must not be skipped. In this case, report generation depends on structured upstream outputs, especially source mappings that preserve provenance through synthesis. A prerequisite check can reject or defer the downstream delegation until the required artifacts exist.

The important mental model is that the coordinator should not treat subagent handoffs as only a prompting problem. In an Agent SDK architecture, the application can validate orchestration state before invoking or allowing the report-generation subagent, and it can use enforcement mechanisms such as hooks where a tool or delegation boundary must be guarded.

Prompt instructions, few-shot examples, and longer runs are useful for shaping behavior, but they remain probabilistic. tool_choice controls whether Claude may, must, or must not use tools, including forcing a named tool, but it is not a dependency checker. For high-integrity handoffs between subagents, validate that the handoff payload is complete before allowing the next step to run.

You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. A CI job will ask Claude Code to review a pull request and automatically post each finding as an inline comment. The downstream script needs predictable fields such as file path, line number, severity, and message, while Claude Code may still need to inspect the repository before producing the final findings. Which implementation is most appropriate?


**A(정답)** . Run claude -p with --output-format json and --json-schema, then parse structured_output for the PR comment payload.

**설명** :
This uses Claude Code's documented non-interactive print mode for automation and constrains the final output with a JSON Schema. With --output-format json and --json-schema, the schema-conforming payload is returned in structured_output, which is suitable for a script that posts inline comments.

**B** . Run claude -p with --output-format stream-json, then concatenate events and parse result for the PR comment payload.

**설명** :
stream-json is intended for newline-delimited streaming output, not as the documented pattern for schema-constrained final CLI output. The schema-constrained pattern uses --output-format json with --json-schema, and without a schema the answer is not returned as validated structured_output.

**C** . Run claude -p with --output-format text, then prompt Claude to print only JSON for the PR comment payload.

**설명** :
Text output can be useful for human-readable automation logs, but it leaves the script dependent on prompt compliance and brittle parsing. It does not use the documented schema validation path that returns a structured_output field.

**D** . Run claude interactively with a review prompt, then capture the terminal transcript and parse the final message.

**설명** :
Interactive Claude Code is not the appropriate mode for CI automation because it is designed for an ongoing terminal session. Capturing a transcript also creates a fragile parsing dependency instead of using the CLI's print-mode structured output features.

### 전반적인 설명

For CI/CD automation, Claude Code should run in print mode with claude -p, because that mode processes a prompt and exits instead of waiting for an interactive session. The documented schema-constrained CLI pattern combines --output-format json with --json-schema, then reads the validated payload from the top-level structured_output field.

The schema controls the final returned data, not the agent's entire workflow. Claude Code can still inspect files and perform multi-step work before returning findings that match the schema, which is exactly what a PR review job needs before posting inline comments. A text-only prompt such as “return JSON” is an anti-pattern for automation because it relies on probabilistic formatting compliance, while transcript parsing is even more brittle.

Use a real JSON Schema for the fields your posting script requires, such as path, line, severity, and message, and keep the schema reasonably simple. If structured output validation cannot succeed within the retry limit, the result is an error rather than usable structured data, so the CI job should handle that failure path explicitly. See the Claude Code CLI reference, Claude Code headless mode documentation, and Agent SDK structured outputs documentation.

You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. During testing, earlier research steps return source-rich findings to the coordinator, but the synthesis subagent often produces uncited summaries. The synthesis delegation currently says: "Use the research gathered so far to draft a cited report." What change should this team make?

**A** . Preload the synthesis subagent with a reporting skill in its skills field.

**설명** :
The skills field preloads full skill content into the subagent, which can be useful for stable procedures or templates. It does not automatically load dynamic findings produced by earlier subagents in the current run.

**B(정답)** . Pass the relevant findings and source metadata directly in the synthesis task message.

**설명** :
Non-fork subagents start with their own isolated context window, so the synthesis subagent cannot rely on the coordinator's transcript being visible. Passing the actual findings and source metadata in the task message gives the subagent the information it needs to produce a cited report.

**C** . Invoke the synthesis subagent with an @-mention for each final report task.

**설명** :
An @-mention guarantees that a specific subagent is selected for one task, but it does not make the parent conversation history visible to that subagent. Claude still writes the delegation prompt, so missing research context can remain missing.

**D** . Allow the synthesis subagent to spawn Agent from its tools configuration.

**설명** :
Listing Agent allows a subagent to perform nested spawning, but spawning capability is not the same as receiving prior sibling outputs. The coordinator should provide the needed context rather than expecting the synthesis subagent to recover it indirectly.

### 전반적인 설명

Subagents are useful because they let specialized assistants work in separate context windows, which keeps intermediate search logs, file reads, and exploratory work from flooding the main conversation. That isolation is also the key tradeoff: a non-fork subagent does not automatically see the parent conversation history, files already read by the parent, or results returned by sibling subagents.

For a research system, the coordinator must treat delegation prompts as explicit handoff packets. The synthesis subagent should receive the relevant findings, excerpts, source URLs or document identifiers, and any citation metadata needed for the final report. A vague instruction like Use the research gathered so far is unreliable because the subagent's local context may not contain that research.

Selection mechanisms and capability configuration solve different problems. An @-mention selects a particular subagent, but it does not transfer hidden parent context. The skills field preloads stable skill content, not run-specific research results. Allowing Agent enables nested spawning, but it does not replace explicit context passing from the coordinator.

You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. A custom MCP server exposes the citation database and document catalog that several subagents need during research runs. One developer added it with the default Claude Code MCP command on their laptop, but other teammates do not see the server when they clone the repository, and the team does not want credentials committed to source control. What should the team do?

**A** . Check the original developer's ~/.claude.json into the repository and have teammates reuse that file.

**설명** :
Copying a developer's ~/.claude.json is not the documented mechanism for shared team MCP server configuration. That file may contain personal, local, or cross-project entries, and it can mix unrelated machine-specific settings with the intended server definition.

**B** . Keep the default local scope and document the claude mcp add command in the onboarding guide.

**설명** :
The default scope for claude mcp add is local, which is private to the current project on the current machine. It is stored under that project entry in ~/.claude.json and does not provide a version-controlled team configuration.

**C(정답)** . Re-add the server with --scope project and commit the generated .mcp.json using environment-variable placeholders.

**설명** :
Project scope is the documented team-sharing scope for Claude Code MCP servers. It stores the server definition in a project-root .mcp.json file that can be committed, while environment-variable placeholders can keep credentials or machine-specific values out of source control.

**D** . Re-add the server with --scope user and ask each teammate to rely on their own ~/.claude.json file.

**설명** :
User scope stores MCP server configuration in ~/.claude.json and makes it available across projects on that one machine. It is appropriate for personal utility servers, but it is not shared with teammates through the repository.

### 전반적인 설명

Claude Code MCP server scope determines both where a server loads and whether its configuration is shared. For team-standard tooling in a repository, the documented choice is project scope, which writes an .mcp.json file at the project root so the server definition can travel with the codebase.

User scope and local scope both use ~/.claude.json, but they do not serve the same purpose as project sharing. User-scoped servers are private but available across projects on one machine, while local-scoped servers are private to one project on one machine and are the default when adding an MCP server without a scope.

For shared configurations that need credentials or machine-specific values, .mcp.json can use environment-variable expansion such as ${VAR} or ${VAR:-default}. The server scope is fixed when added, so changing a server from local or user scope to project scope means removing the existing entry and re-adding it with the desired scope. See Claude Code MCP and MCP quickstart.

You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. This team uses Claude Code while maintaining the repository for the system described above. They want citation and source-handling conventions to be shared by every developer, report-generator guidance to apply only when working in the report agent's directory, and personal editor preferences to remain private. Which configuration approach best matches Claude Code's memory hierarchy?

**A** . Put shared conventions in the report agent's CLAUDE.md, put personal preferences in root CLAUDE.md, and rely on subdirectory files to override parent files.

**설명** :
A subdirectory CLAUDE.md is too narrow for conventions that should apply across the whole repository. Claude Code concatenates applicable memory files from broader to more specific scopes, so treating child files as overriding parent files misrepresents how memory is assembled.

**B(정답)** . Put shared conventions in root CLAUDE.md or .claude/CLAUDE.md, put report-agent guidance in that directory's CLAUDE.md, and keep personal preferences in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.

**설명** :
This uses the documented scopes for Claude Code memory: project instructions for team-shared repository guidance, directory-level instructions for area-specific context, and user instructions for personal preferences. It also matches the broad-to-specific loading model, where relevant CLAUDE.md files are combined as context rather than treated as hard enforcement.

**C** . Put all conventions in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md, add report-agent notes under .claude/settings.json, and ask each developer to copy the same files locally.

**설명** :
User-level memory is personal and applies across projects, so it is not the right place for team-shared repository conventions. Project settings are a different mechanism from CLAUDE.md memory, and copying user files locally creates inconsistent behavior across developers.

**D** . Put shared conventions in CLAUDE.local.md, put report-agent guidance in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md, and commit the user-level file for the team.

**설명** :
CLAUDE.local.md is intended for private project-specific notes, not team-shared instructions. The user-level file under ~/.claude is personal and should not be committed as the mechanism for repository-wide guidance.

### 전반적인 설명

Claude Code memory is best understood as layered context, not as a permissions system. Team-wide repository guidance belongs in project instructions such as CLAUDE.md at the repository root or .claude/CLAUDE.md, while personal preferences belong in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.

Directory-level CLAUDE.md files are useful when a portion of the codebase has specialized conventions, such as report-generation rules that should travel with the report agent's directory. Claude Code loads memory from broader to more specific locations and concatenates the content, so engineers should not design these files as if lower-level files replace higher-level ones.

Where Claude Code is launched also matters in large repositories, because it affects the initial working scope and which directory memories are immediately loaded. For configuration details, see Claude Code memory and Claude Code large codebases.

Independent sessions can be useful for parallel work, but they are not the same as delegated subagents inside one Claude Code session. Pasting full transcripts reintroduces the context-flooding problem the workflow is trying to avoid.

**B** . Assign a general-purpose subagent to modify the report code while it searches for citation-loss causes.

**설명** :
The general-purpose subagent can perform complex multi-step work and has broader tool access, including modification capabilities. For an investigation that should preserve coordination and avoid unnecessary changes, a focused read-only delegation is the safer fit.

**C(정답)** . Delegate focused read-only investigations to subagents, then use their returned summaries in the main conversation.

**설명** :
Claude Code subagents are designed to do side work in their own context window and return results or summaries to the main conversation. This keeps noisy exploration output out of the main thread while preserving the main agent's high-level coordination role.

**D** . Ask the main conversation to inspect every relevant file directly, then compact the conversation after each phase.

**설명** :
Compaction can reduce context usage after verbose exploration, but it does not prevent the main conversation from being filled with low-level discovery output first. It also risks losing nuance during repeated summarization.

### 전반적인 설명

For long codebase investigations, the useful pattern is to keep the main conversation responsible for coordination and delegate narrow discovery tasks to subagents. Claude Code subagents run side work in their own context window and return a result or summary, which helps avoid flooding the main context with file contents, search results, and command output.

This matters because context is not just a size limit problem. Large volumes of raw discovery output can dilute attention and make later reasoning less reliable, especially when the important issue is a small provenance detail such as citation preservation. A focused read-only investigation, for example asking a subagent to find all report-generation tests or trace where citation metadata is transformed, gives the main conversation compact evidence it can compare and synthesize.

The documented built-in subagents have different tool and model profiles. Explore is suited to read-only code discovery, while Plan is read-only for plan-mode research and general-purpose has broader capabilities for complex work, including modifications. Choosing a read-only investigation path reduces accidental changes and keeps the workflow aligned with diagnosing the problem before editing. See Claude Code subagents for the documented delegation model, built-in agents, and isolation behavior.

You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. The team has added a lengthy checklist for producing patent landscape reports to the root memory file. It includes step-by-step source triage, claim grouping, citation formatting, and final report assembly, but it is relevant only to a small subset of research tasks. Developers notice unrelated Claude Code sessions now carry this specialized procedure as context. What should the team do?

**A** . Replace the checklist with a PreToolUse hook that blocks report generation until each checklist item is complete.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because the problem is where to store procedural guidance, not how to enforce a forbidden tool action. Hooks are appropriate for blocking or controlling tool use regardless of Claude's decision, not for loading long task instructions only when needed.

**B** . Move all citation and source provenance rules into the same skill and leave CLAUDE.md empty.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because rules that should apply across every research session belong in CLAUDE.md. Putting universal citation expectations only in a specialized skill risks omitting them when the skill is not used.

**C(정답)** . Move the patent landscape procedure into a SKILL.md-based skill and keep only universal research conventions in CLAUDE.md.

**설명** :
This is correct because the lengthy material is a task-specific procedure rather than guidance needed in every session. Skills are designed for repeatable workflows and their bodies are loaded only when the skill is used, while CLAUDE.md should retain persistent universal facts and conventions.

**D** . Keep the full patent landscape procedure in CLAUDE.md and add a note saying to ignore it unless relevant.

**설명** :
This is incorrect because the full procedure still consumes context when CLAUDE.md is loaded. Telling Claude to ignore irrelevant material does not recover the context budget or separate occasional workflows from persistent guidance.

### 전반적인 설명

CLAUDE.md is best for persistent guidance that should shape every Claude Code session, such as project layout, build commands, conventions, and rules that always apply. It is read as context, so placing long niche procedures there increases the amount of material Claude carries even when the current task does not need it.

Skills are a better fit for repeatable, task-specific workflows such as a patent landscape report checklist. A skill is defined with SKILL.md, can be used when relevant or invoked directly with /skill-name, and its body is loaded only when the skill is used, which preserves context for unrelated work.

A useful mental model is: put the always true facts and standards in CLAUDE.md, and put the occasionally executed procedure in a skill. If the team needed to block a tool action regardless of Claude's judgment, a hook could be appropriate, but that is a different problem from managing task-specific instructions. See Claude Code skills and Claude Code memory.

You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses the built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. A platform engineering team is running an automated codebase inventory, and the agent extracts endpoint metadata from a legacy router file into JSON for downstream tooling. Your validator rejects the extraction because one required field is missing, one enum value is invalid, and one handler name does not appear in the source. What follow-up request design is most appropriate for the retry?

**A** . Send a compact correction request containing only the validator errors, then ask Claude to infer the intended field changes from the prior attempt.

**설명** :
A correction request that contains only errors is under-specified because Claude may not have the prior source and failed extraction unless the application sends them again. Without the original document, the model cannot reliably verify whether the corrected handler name or missing field is grounded in the code.

**B** . Retry with schema-constrained JSON output using the same schema, then let the schema enforcement supply the missing source details.

**설명** :
Schema-constrained output can reduce malformed JSON and schema violations, but it does not provide missing evidence from the source document. It also cannot tell Claude which prior values failed validation unless the application includes the failed extraction and specific errors.

**C** . Retry the initial extraction request at temperature 0 with the original document, the schema, and instructions to be more careful about JSON validity.

**설명** :
Lowering temperature or rerunning the original prompt does not directly address the specific validation failures. Omitting the rejected JSON also removes useful context about which candidate values the validator already found unacceptable.

**D(정답)** . Send a new Messages API request with XML-tagged sections for the original document, rejected JSON, validator errors, and instructions to return only corrected structured data.

**설명** :
This is the most reliable correction pattern because the Messages API is stateless, so the application must provide the context Claude needs in the retry. Separating the source, failed output, and validation errors with XML tags reduces ambiguity and lets Claude repair the extraction against concrete evidence.

### 전반적인 설명

For failed structured extraction, think of the retry as a normal multi-turn Messages API request, not a special recovery mode. The Messages API is stateless, so your application should send the relevant context again, including the source document, the failed extraction, and the precise validation errors Claude should repair.

XML tags are useful because correction prompts mix several kinds of content: <original_document>, <failed_extraction>, <validation_errors>, and <instructions>. This helps Claude distinguish evidence from rejected output and from the task instructions, which is especially important when the source is long or data-rich.

Structured output mechanisms can reduce common formatting and schema failures, but they do not replace application-side validation or a well-grounded correction prompt. A retry that omits the original source, the rejected extraction, or the exact validation errors asks Claude to guess rather than repair against concrete criteria.

You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. The report-generation step consistently receives the same structured findings from the synthesis subagent, but its prose output varies: some reports keep one cited bullet per finding, while others merge findings, drop evidence excerpts, or move source dates into a footnote. The current instruction says, "Turn each finding into a concise cited bullet with complete source details." What change would most directly improve consistency of this transformation?

**A** . Move the citation-format instruction into settings.json so Claude Code treats it as shared project configuration.

**설명** :
Claude Code settings configure permissions, environment variables, and tool behavior, not the semantic transformation pattern for report prose. The issue is not a missing setting, it is an underspecified instruction that needs clearer examples in the prompt or reusable workflow.

**B** . Add a broader instruction that all cited bullets must preserve source details and avoid unsupported claims throughout.

**설명** :
This restates the desired behavior, but it does not show the model how to transform the actual input shape into the desired output shape. Broad instructions can help, but they are weaker than concrete examples when the failure is inconsistent interpretation of a format or transformation rule.

**C** . Add a PreToolUse hook that blocks report writing whenever a cited bullet omits a publication date.

**설명** :
A hook can enforce or block tool actions, but it does not teach the report generator how to consistently format each finding. This approach is also too narrow because the observed failures include merging findings and dropping evidence excerpts, not only missing publication dates.

**D(정답)** . Add a short examples block showing representative finding inputs and ideal cited-bullet outputs, including edge cases.

**설명** :
Concrete input/output examples demonstrate the exact transformation boundary that the prose instruction leaves ambiguous. Including representative and edge-case examples helps Claude preserve the intended structure without needing to infer what “complete source details” means each time.

### 전반적인 설명

When Claude handles a repeated transformation and prose instructions produce inconsistent results, few-shot or multishot prompting is often the most direct refinement. A small set of input/output examples makes the desired mapping concrete: one finding in, one cited bullet out, with the evidence excerpt, source, and date placed exactly where the team expects them.

Anthropic’s prompting guidance recommends using well-crafted examples to improve accuracy and consistency, and emphasizes that examples should be relevant, diverse, and structured with tags such as <example> or <examples>. XML-style tags help separate instructions, examples, and live inputs, but the tags are organizational aids rather than hard enforcement. See Multishot prompting for the documented guidance on examples and structured prompt sections.

Configuration and enforcement mechanisms solve different problems. Claude Code settings.json is for tool behavior and environment configuration, while hooks are useful when a tool action must be blocked or constrained. For a formatting transformation in generated prose, the better first move is to clarify the desired transformation with concrete, verifiable examples rather than moving vague wording into configuration or relying on a blocking mechanism.

You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. Your team’s /doc-extract command produces valid JSON for an internal documentation catalog, but evals show a recurring issue: fields such as owner and minimum_supported_version are returned as null when the source document presents them in tables, YAML front matter, or narrative release notes. The fields are present in the source, but the command’s prompt only describes the schema and says to extract all required fields. What change would most directly improve extraction consistency?


**A(정답)** . Add 3 to 5 relevant, diverse, structured examples showing varied source formats and the expected extracted output.

**설명** :
Few-shot or multishot examples are well suited when Claude needs to learn extraction patterns across varied document structures. Relevant and diverse examples teach the decision boundary for where fields appear, while structured examples make the desired output format and mapping explicit.

**B** . Add a stronger instruction that required fields must never be returned as null when generating catalog JSON.

**설명** :
A stronger instruction may reduce nulls superficially, but it can encourage guessing when a field is hard to locate. The problem is not JSON compliance or effort, it is that the prompt has not demonstrated how to map different document formats to the required fields.

**C** . Make the affected schema fields nullable so the command accepts absent values without validation failures.

**설명** :
Nullable fields are appropriate when the source may genuinely omit information, but the issue states the fields are present. This change would mask missed extractions rather than teach Claude how to find the values in varied formats.

**D** . Lower the temperature for the command so the extraction behavior becomes more deterministic across repeated runs.

**설명** :
Lower temperature can reduce output variability, but it does not provide new information about how to interpret tables, front matter, or narrative phrasing. A deterministic prompt can still consistently miss the same fields when the extraction pattern is underspecified.

### 전반적인 설명

When a structured extraction task fails on varied document formats, examples often provide a better signal than more prose rules. Anthropic’s prompt engineering guidance describes few-shot or multishot prompting as one of the most reliable ways to steer output format, tone, and structure, and to improve accuracy and consistency.

The key is not to add random examples. The examples should be relevant to the real catalog extraction task, diverse across the formats that are failing, and structured so Claude can clearly distinguish the source document from the expected output. Wrapping examples in <examples> and each case in <example> also helps keep instructions, examples, and variable input separate.

Changing the schema to allow nulls is useful only when a value may truly be absent, not when evals show Claude is missing present information. Lower temperature and stronger wording can make behavior more consistent, but they do not teach Claude where the same field appears across tables, YAML front matter, and narrative text. See Anthropic’s guidance on few-shot and multishot prompting.

You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses the built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. During a pilot, the system described above sometimes runs Bash commands that modify files outside an approved workspace after engineers give broad cleanup requests. The workspace boundary is a non-negotiable rule: commands targeting paths outside the workspace must be stopped before they run, and Claude should receive feedback about the violation. What change should this team make?

**A** . Add a stronger system prompt that instructs Claude to inspect every Bash command and avoid out-of-workspace paths.

**설명** :
A system prompt can guide behavior, but it relies on the model choosing to follow the instruction on each turn. That is not sufficient when the requirement is to stop every violating command before execution.

**B** . Add a PreToolUse command hook for Bash that logs out-of-workspace commands and exits without blocking.

**설명** :
A logging-only PreToolUse hook may improve auditing, but it does not enforce the workspace boundary. If the hook exits without a blocking decision, it has not stopped the unsafe command from continuing through the normal flow.

**C(정답)** . Add a PreToolUse command hook for Bash that validates target paths and blocks out-of-workspace commands with feedback.

**설명** :
This enforces the workspace boundary before the Bash command executes, which is necessary for a non-negotiable rule. A command hook provides deterministic control, and a blocking PreToolUse hook can prevent the action while returning feedback to Claude.

**D** . Add a PostToolUse command hook for Bash that detects out-of-workspace changes and asks Claude to revert them.

**설명** :
A PostToolUse hook runs only after a successful tool call, so it cannot prevent the unauthorized Bash command from executing. It can provide feedback, but it cannot guarantee that the original side effect did not happen.

### 전반적인 설명

For a rule that must be enforced every time, use a hook as a control point rather than relying on instructions in the prompt. Claude Code hooks are designed for lifecycle automation and deterministic control, so required actions or checks happen consistently instead of depending on the model to choose them. The official hooks guide describes this distinction directly in Claude Code hooks guide.

The timing of the hook matters. PreToolUse fires before a tool call executes and can block the call, which fits a boundary such as "do not run Bash outside this workspace." PostToolUse is useful for feedback after successful tool use, but it is too late for prevention because the command has already run, as described in Claude Code hooks reference.

The hook must also make an enforcement decision, not merely observe the event. A command hook receives event-specific JSON on stdin and communicates through documented outputs or exit behavior, including blocking a PreToolUse action and returning feedback. Logging violations can support monitoring, but it does not satisfy a requirement that unsafe commands be stopped before execution.

You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses the built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This team extracts structured refactor candidates from legacy source files after using Read and Grep. The JSON schema now prevents malformed JSON, but logs still show two issues: some responses return with stop_reason: "max_tokens", and some schema-valid findings cite line numbers that do not exist in the referenced file. What should the extraction loop do to improve reliability?

**A** . Treat pause_turn as a client-tool failure, send an error tool_result, and restart the extraction from scratch.

**설명** :
pause_turn is a continuation case for server tools, not a generic signal that a client tool failed. Client tool execution failures should be represented with tool_result and is_error only when the model has requested client tool use.

**B(정답)** . Check stop_reason, retry truncated generations with a larger output limit, then return specific semantic validation errors for correction.

**설명** :
This addresses both observed failure modes with the right mechanism for each one. A max_tokens stop reason indicates the response may be incomplete, while invalid line numbers require application-level semantic validation and targeted feedback.

**C** . Trust schema-constrained JSON, skip line validation, and retry only when the JSON parser raises a syntax error.

**설명** :
Schema-constrained JSON reduces format failures, but it does not prove that extracted values are semantically correct. A line number can match the schema type while still being invalid for the referenced file.

**D** . Retry every rejected extraction with the same prompt, same output limit, and no validator feedback.

**설명** :
Repeating the same request without changing the failure condition is unlikely to fix truncation or semantic mistakes. Validation-retry loops work best when the model receives specific errors it can act on.

### 전반적인 설명

Schema-constrained output is an important reliability layer, but it is not the whole extraction system. It can make the response conform to the requested structure, while application code still needs to inspect completion state and validate domain facts such as whether cited files and line ranges actually exist.

For a response with stop_reason: "max_tokens", the documented risk is that the output may be incomplete, so the retry should change the condition that caused the failure, for example by allowing a larger output. For schema-valid but semantically wrong findings, the right pattern is a validation-retry loop: run deterministic checks, send the precise validation errors back with the relevant source context, and ask Claude to correct the structured extraction.

Do not treat a valid JSON schema as proof of extraction correctness. Also avoid blind retries, since they waste latency and cost without giving Claude new information. For tool-related stop reasons, use the documented handling for that stop reason rather than conflating pause_turn, tool_use, and ordinary validation failures.

Relevant documentation: Structured outputs, Handling stop reasons, and Handle tool calls.

You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. The repository already includes a shared project skill at .claude/skills/code-review/SKILL.md. You want your own stricter review workflow available across your projects, but you do not want to change teammates' behavior or shadow the existing /code-review skill. What should you do?


**A(정답)** . Create ~/.claude/skills/my-code-review/SKILL.md and invoke it as /my-code-review.

**설명** :
Personal skills belong under ~/.claude/skills/ and apply to you across all projects without being shared through the repository. Using a different skill directory name also creates a distinct slash command, avoiding a name collision with the project skill.

**B** . Add stricter review instructions to project CLAUDE.md and invoke the existing /code-review.

**설명** :
Project CLAUDE.md is shared project context and is loaded broadly, not an on-demand personal skill body. This would not create a separate personal command and could affect teammates if the file is committed.

**C** . Edit .claude/skills/code-review/SKILL.md with stricter rules and invoke it as /code-review.

**설명** :
A skill under .claude/skills/ is project scoped and can affect collaborators when committed to the repository. This changes the team's shared skill rather than creating a personal variant for your own workflow.

**D** . Create ~/.claude/skills/code-review/SKILL.md with name: my-code-review and invoke /my-code-review.

**설명** :
For normal personal and project skills, the slash command comes from the skill directory name, not the frontmatter display name. This would still create a personal /code-review skill, which would override the project skill of the same name for you.

### 전반적인 설명

Claude Code distinguishes personal scope from project scope. A personal skill lives under ~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md and applies to you across projects, while a project skill lives under .claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md and is intended for that repository. This makes personal scope the right place for workflow customization that should not be shared with teammates.

The subtle point is naming. For normal skill directories, the slash command is derived from the <skill-name> directory, so ~/.claude/skills/my-code-review/SKILL.md creates /my-code-review. Changing the frontmatter name alone does not change the command for a normal skill directory.

Name collisions are also operationally important. If a personal skill uses the same name as a project skill, the personal skill takes precedence over the project skill for that user. Creating a differently named personal variant avoids both team impact and accidental shadowing of the shared command.

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. The team adds client tools named classify_document, extract_candidate_fields, validate_extraction, and queue_human_review. The documents differ enough that some records need several validation passes, some should be routed to review, and some requests may not need any tool call. Which design best lets Claude adapt its next action to each document while keeping the application responsible for execution?


**A(정답)** . Define the tools with clear descriptions and schemas, then run a loop that executes each tool_use request and returns matching tool_result blocks.

**설명** :
This approach uses the documented tool-use contract: Claude decides when and how to call available tools, while the application executes the requested client tools. The loop is driven by structured stop reasons and tool_use blocks, so Claude can choose different next actions based on the current document and prior results.

**B** . Parse Claude's natural-language response for phrases like needs validation, then invoke the corresponding extraction tool.

**설명** :
Natural-language parsing is a brittle control mechanism compared with using structured stop_reason and tool_use blocks. It can also miss cases where Claude emits multiple tool calls in one assistant turn, each with its own id, name, and input.

**C** . Build a fixed controller that always calls classify_document, extract_candidate_fields, validate_extraction, and queue_human_review in that order.

**설명** :
This approach turns the system into a preconfigured sequence rather than allowing Claude to choose the next action from context. It also routes every document to review, which removes the flexibility needed for documents that can be resolved without escalation.

**D** . Set tool_choice to {"type":"tool","name":"validate_extraction"} on every turn, then route later steps from the validation output.

**설명** :
Forcing a specific tool call constrains the next response, but it is not a mechanism for defining adaptive multi-step branching. While tool_choice can be useful for output control, using it on every turn would prevent Claude from choosing other tools or responding directly when appropriate.

### 전반적인 설명

The practical distinction is that an agentic tool loop is model-driven, not a hand-authored decision tree. With tools available and the default tool_choice: {"type": "auto"}, Claude can decide on each turn whether to call a tool or answer directly, using the user request, tool descriptions, and accumulated context.

Your application still owns execution. For client tools, Claude emits structured tool_use blocks and the response has stop_reason: "tool_use"; your code runs the named tool and sends back a tool_result tied to the original tool_use_id. The generic loop repeats while Claude continues requesting tools, then stops when the response reaches another stop reason such as end_turn.

tool_choice values such as any or tool are useful when you need to force tool use in the next response, but they are not a full workflow language for multi-step branching. For variable document extraction, the more scalable design is to provide well-described tools and let Claude select the next action, while enforcing hard business constraints in application logic when needed.

You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. During evaluation, the web-search subagent sometimes hits transient network errors after finding a few useful sources. The coordinator only receives a generic failure message and either stops the report or omits the section. What change best improves resilience while preserving subagent isolation?

**A** . Have the coordinator inspect the search subagent's intermediate tool calls, then decide whether to retry or continue with partial sources.

**설명** :
The parent conversation does not see a subagent's intermediate tool calls or tool outputs when it is launched through the built-in Agent tool. Relying on those hidden details would leave the coordinator without the information it needs.

**B(정답)** . Have the search subagent retry transient failures locally, then return attempted queries, unresolved error context, and any partial sources.

**설명** :
This keeps transient recovery inside the specialized worker while giving the coordinator enough information to make an informed decision if recovery fails. Because the parent receives only the subagent's final text result, partial sources and attempted queries must be included in that returned result.

**C** . Have the search subagent inherit all parent tools, then use alternate tools whenever the primary search path fails.

**설명** :
Broader tool access does not solve error propagation and can make tool selection less reliable. A subagent should receive scoped tools for its role and should report what it attempted when it cannot recover locally.

**D** . Have the search subagent return an empty successful result whenever search fails, then let the synthesis agent infer coverage gaps.

**설명** :
Returning an empty success hides the difference between a valid no-results search and a failed search. The coordinator needs explicit failure context and partial findings, not silent suppression of errors.

### 전반적인 설명

For transient failures in a multi-agent research flow, the best pattern is local recovery first, followed by structured propagation only when the subagent cannot resolve the issue. A search subagent can retry a timeout or try a narrower query within its own context, but if it still cannot complete the assignment, it should return a final result that includes what it attempted, the unresolved failure, and any usable partial sources.

This matters because Claude Code subagents launched by the built-in Agent tool run in a separate context window and return one text result to the parent. The coordinator does not automatically receive the subagent's intermediate tool calls, raw logs, or partial outputs, so any information needed for recovery or synthesis must be intentionally included in the subagent's final response. See Claude Code subagents and the Claude Code tools reference.

Suppressing failures as empty successes is a common anti-pattern because it makes missing evidence indistinguishable from evidence that genuinely does not exist. Expanding a subagent's tool access is also not a substitute for good error reporting, since tool scope and error propagation solve different problems.

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. A regional hospital network's claims automation team is building a structured data extraction workflow. During extraction, some records require escalation because the source document conflicts with account data. Reviewers will not receive the full model conversation or tool history, and the receiving queue requires the escalation packet to be the model's final response rather than tool-call arguments. It needs consistent JSON with customer identifiers, suspected root cause, and recommended next action. What design should this team use?

**A** . Send raw excerpts and conversation history as the reviewer handoff for manual reconstruction.

**설명** :
This pushes the reconstruction work onto reviewers instead of producing the required escalation packet. It also conflicts with the stated constraint that reviewers will not receive the full model conversation or tool history.

**B** . Require only a schema-defined escalation tool call as the final reviewer handoff.

**설명** :
A schema-defined tool call can validate how Claude calls a function, including the shape of its arguments. It does not meet the stated requirement that the reviewer packet be the model's final response rather than tool-call arguments.

**C(정답)** . Generate a schema-validated escalation packet with Structured outputs as the final reviewer handoff.

**설명** :
Structured outputs are the appropriate mechanism when the final model response must be valid JSON matching a defined schema. This design also addresses the reviewer constraint by making the handoff self-contained rather than dependent on hidden conversation or tool history.

**D** . Add prompt instructions that write escalation notes with consistent headings as the reviewer handoff.

**설명** :
Prompt instructions can encourage a consistent format, but they do not provide the same schema validation as Structured outputs. For downstream JSON parsing and routing, relying only on prose formatting is less reliable than constraining the final response to a schema.

### 전반적인 설명

The key design choice is driven by where the handoff must appear. Because the receiving queue requires the escalation packet to be the model's final response, the workflow should constrain that response to a predictable JSON structure rather than treating an internal tool invocation as the reviewer artifact.

Structured outputs are designed for cases where downstream systems need valid JSON that conforms to a JSON Schema. That makes them a good fit for a self-contained escalation packet containing durable review facts such as customer identifiers, suspected root cause, and recommended next action. See Structured outputs.

Tool calling can still be useful in an agentic workflow, for example to create a case record or notify a routing service. However, strict tool use validates how Claude calls functions, while Structured outputs constrain what Claude returns as the structured final answer. When the reviewer handoff itself must be the final model output, schema-validated Structured outputs are the more direct mechanism.

You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. A custom /fix-ticket command uses an issue lookup MCP tool before editing code and generating a commit message. In testing, when a ticket title search returns several similar tickets, Claude Code sometimes continues with the newest ticket and implements the wrong request. What change should this team make to improve reliability?

**A** . Update CLAUDE.md to prefer title similarity when choosing between matching tickets.

**설명** :
Project instructions can guide behavior, but title similarity is still a heuristic. The reliability issue requires a clarification step when the tool result does not identify a single target.

**B** . Update the command to select the newest matching ticket before modifying project files.

**설명** :
This replaces an ambiguous decision with a heuristic, which can still choose the wrong ticket. Recency may be useful metadata, but it is not a unique identifier for a development task.

**C** . Update the lookup tool to return only the highest-ranked ticket in each search result.

**설명** :
This hides ambiguity from Claude rather than resolving it. If several tickets plausibly match, suppressing alternatives can make the system appear confident while acting on incomplete information.

**D(정답)** . Update the lookup tool description to require clarification when multiple candidate tickets are returned.

**설명** :
This directly changes the tool contract Claude sees when deciding how to use the lookup result. Multiple matches are an ambiguity, so the reliable behavior is to ask for an additional identifier before taking downstream actions.

### 전반적인 설명

Tool use works best when the tool contract makes ambiguity explicit. A lookup that returns several plausible tickets has not produced a safe target for file edits, commit messages, or issue updates, so the tool description should tell Claude to ask for a unique identifier, such as an issue key or ticket number, before continuing.

Anthropic describes tool use as a contract where the application defines available operations and their input and output shapes, while Claude decides when and how to call them. Detailed plaintext tool descriptions are the right place to explain behavior, caveats, and limitations, including what to do when a result is ambiguous. See How tool use works and Implement tool use.

The unreliable alternatives all encode a heuristic, such as recency, title similarity, or highest rank. Those approaches may reduce friction, but they do not establish that the selected ticket is the user's intended ticket. When a tool result represents an obstacle, the system should expose that obstacle to Claude so it can retry, ask for clarification, or explain the limitation rather than silently proceeding, as described in Build a tool-using agent.

You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. A payments platform engineering team is running a multi-hour refactor investigation. Claude Code correctly identifies several legacy payment-flow dependencies early on. After many file reads, searches, and a compaction step, later answers start omitting those dependencies and referring to typical patterns instead of the specific findings. Which change would best preserve the investigation state for subsequent questions?

**A** . Keep all Grep and Read outputs in the active chat and avoid writing durable investigation notes.

**설명** :
Verbose tool outputs are a major contributor to context pressure in long codebase explorations. Keeping everything only in chat makes confirmed findings compete with large volumes of lower-value file and search output.

**B** . Move the refactor into plan mode and rely on the plan to preserve prior file-analysis details.

**설명** :
Plan mode helps Claude outline an approach before making changes, but it is not a durable record of every investigation finding. A plan can still omit or lose important details if confirmed facts are not stored somewhere Claude can reload.

**C(정답)** . Have the investigation agent maintain a concise investigation-notes.md file of confirmed dependencies and read it before follow-up questions.

**설명** :
A durable notes file gives Claude a stable place to store confirmed findings outside the active conversation context. Reading it before follow-up questions helps restore specific investigation state after long sessions, compaction, or many tool outputs.

**D** . Add a longer session-start instruction telling Claude to remember every payment dependency it identifies.

**설명** :
A chat instruction can help guide behavior, but it does not create durable state outside the current context window. In long sessions, early instructions and details can become less salient or be summarized as the context fills.

### 전반적인 설명

Long Claude Code sessions are vulnerable to context degradation: many turns and verbose tool outputs can make earlier findings less available to the model. A concise investigation notes file works as a practical scratchpad, preserving confirmed architecture facts, dependencies, decisions, and open questions in a form Claude can explicitly reread before continuing.

This pattern is different from hard enforcement. Durable context helps continuity, but Claude still needs to be instructed to consult and update the notes, and the file should stay concise enough to remain useful. For persistent project rules, CLAUDE.md is the documented memory mechanism, while an investigation notes file is a project artifact the agent can maintain with normal file operations.

See Claude Code memory for documented persistent context mechanisms, including CLAUDE.md, scoped rules, skills, and subagent memory. See How Claude Code works for how Claude Code manages a filling context window during long sessions.

You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates the output using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. The research team splits long documents across extraction subagents. In validation, the synthesizer combines several extracted statistics into a single trend, and reviewers later find that two values reflected different collection periods and measurement methods. Logs show each extraction subagent returned a concise prose summary of relevant findings. What change most directly improves synthesis reliability?

**A** . Send the complete extracted text from every document to the synthesizer for independent provenance reconstruction.

**설명** :
This may give the synthesizer more raw material, but it increases context load and forces it to rediscover provenance after extraction has already occurred. It is less reliable than preserving high-signal claim metadata at the point each subagent finds the evidence.

**B** . Run each extraction subagent as a fork so it inherits the parent conversation before returning its summary.

**설명** :
Forking can preserve parent conversation context, but it does not automatically add provenance fields to the returned summary. The synthesizer still needs explicit source locations, dates, and method context in the handoff it receives.

**C(정답)** . Require each subagent to return structured evidence records with the claim, source location, document date, and method context.

**설명** :
This directly improves the handoff by making provenance and methodological context part of each subagent's returned output. Because downstream synthesis only receives what the coordinator passes forward, these fields must be preserved before summarization compresses the evidence.

**D** . Validate that each extraction subagent returns JSON before the synthesizer processes its summary.

**설명** :
JSON validation can make output parsing more reliable, but it only checks the shape that the workflow asks for. If the schema does not require source locations, dates, and method context, validation can still pass while synthesis loses the evidence needed to compare claims accurately.

### 전반적인 설명

When extraction work is delegated to subagents, the main workflow should treat each subagent result as a handoff artifact, not as a complete replayable investigation. The Claude Code subagents documentation explains that subagents work in their own context and return a summary to the main conversation, so downstream synthesis can only use the information that summary preserves.

For synthesis across sources, concise prose is often too lossy. A robust output contract should preserve a structured mapping such as claim, source_location, document_date, and method_context, so later stages can distinguish temporal differences, sampling differences, page-level evidence, and true contradictions. JSON schema based validation can help make responses parseable, but schema validation is only useful for provenance if those provenance fields are part of the required structure.

The reliable pattern is to return high-signal evidence records rather than either unstructured summaries or entire raw documents. Anthropic's tool use implementation guidance similarly emphasizes designing responses around the fields Claude actually needs, because bloated responses waste context and obscure what matters.
